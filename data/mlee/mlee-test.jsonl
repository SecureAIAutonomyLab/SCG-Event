{"text": "Bradycardia-induced coronary angiogenesis is dependent on vascular endothelial growth factor.\n\nA marked coronary angiogenesis is known to occur with chronic bradycardia. We tested the hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell mitogen and a major regulator of angiogenesis, is upregulated in response to low heart rate and consequential increased stroke volume. Bradycardia was induced in rats by administering the bradycardic drug alinidine (3 mg/kg body weight) twice daily. Heart rate decreased by 32% for 20 to 40 minutes after injection and was chronically reduced by 10%, 14%, and 18.5% after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of treatment, respectively. Arterial pressure and cardiac output were unchanged. Left ventricular capillary length density (mm/mm(3)) increased gradually with alinidine administration; a 15% increase after 2 weeks and a 40% increase after 3 weeks of alinidine treatment were documented. Left ventricular weight, body weight, and their ratio were not significantly altered by alinidine treatment. After 1 week of treatment, before an increase in capillary length density, VEGF mRNA increased  greater than 2-fold and then declined to control levels after 3 weeks of treatment. VEGF protein was higher in alinidine-treated rats than in controls after 2 weeks and increased further after 3 weeks of treatment. Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibodies over a 2-week period completely blocked alinidine-stimulated angiogenesis. In contrast, bFGF mRNA was not altered by alinidine treatment. These data suggest that VEGF plays a key role in the angiogenic response that occurs with chronic bradycardia. The mechanism underlying this VEGF-associated angiogenesis may be an increase in stretch due to enhanced diastolic filling.", "events": [{"trigger": "induced", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "dependent", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "upregulated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "administering", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "increased", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "administration", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "increase", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "increase", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "treatment", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "treatment", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "increase", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "increased", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "declined", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "treated", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "increased", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "Injection", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "blocked", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "stimulated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "altered", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "treatment", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "plays a key role", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "angiogenic", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "associated", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}]}
{"text": "External beam radiotherapy for subretinal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration: is this treatment efficient?\n\nPURPOSE: Control of the natural course of subretinal neovascularization (SRNV) in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is difficult. Only a subset of patients is suitable for laser coagulation. This prospective study aimed to determine the efficacy and individual benefit of external beam radiotherapy (EBRT). METHODS AND MATERIALS: The prospective trial included 287 patients with subfoveal neovascularization due to AMD which was verified by fluorescein angiography. Patients have been treated between January 1996 and October 1997. All patients received a total dose of 16 Gy in 2-Gy daily fractions with 5-6 MeV photons based on computerized treatment planning in individual head mask fixation. This first analysis is based on 73 patients (50 women, 23 men, median age 74.3 years), with a median follow-up of 13.3 months and a minimum follow-up of 11 months. RESULTS: All patients completed therapy and tolerability was good. First clinical control with second angiography was performed 6 weeks after irradiation, then in 3-month intervals. Eighteen patients with SRNV refusing radiotherapy served as a control group and were matched with 18 irradiated patients. After 7 months median visual acuity (VA) was 20/160 for the irradiated and 20/400 for the untreated patients. One year after radiotherapy final median VA was 20/400 in both groups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that 16 Gy of conventionally fractionated external beam irradiation slows down the visual loss in exudative AMD for only a few months.

Despite these suggestive observations, no formal proof is as yet available for the concept that angiogenesis is a physiologic event that occurs all over the mature mammalian integument whenever hair follicles switch from resting (telogen) to active growth (anagen). This study uses quantitative histomorphometry and double-immunohistologic detection techniques for the demarcation of proliferating endothelial cells, to show that synchronized hair follicle cycling in adolescent C57BL/6 mice is associated with substantial angiogenesis, and that inhibiting angiogenesis in vivo by the intraperitoneal application of a fumagillin derivative retards experimentally induced anagen development in these mice. Thus, angiogenesis is a physiologic event in normal postnatal murine skin, apparently is dictated by the hair follicle, and appears to be required for normal anagen development.

One mechanism by which alpha-MSH exerts its effects is modulation of AP-1 and NF-kappa B. These two transcription factors also play an important role in fibroblasts, in extracellular matrix composition, and in cytokine expression. By use of electric mobility shift assays, we demonstrate that alpha-MSH (10(-6) to 10(-14) M) activates AP-1 in human dermal fibroblasts, whereas coincubation with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) results in suppression of its activation. alpha-MSH also induces activation of NF-kappa B but does not modulate DNA binding on costimulation with IL-1 beta. Since AP-1 and NF-kappa B are key elements in controlling interleukin-8 (IL-8) transcription, human fibroblasts were treated with alpha-MSH and IL-1 beta for 24 hours, and cytokine levels in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. alpha-MSH alone had little effect, whereas coincubation with IL-1 beta led to marked downregulation of IL-8 secretion (at most 288 +/- 152 ng/mL) when compared to treatment with IL-1 beta alone (919 +/- 157 ng/mL).

We further support this hypothesis by providing the first evidence that TnI can act on nonendothelial as well as endothelial cells and by demonstrating that this inhibitory action is specific for the bFGF receptor on the target cells.

{"text": "Pten signaling in gliomas.\n\nIn 1997, the PTEN gene (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) was identified as a tumor suppressor gene on the long arm of chromosome 10. Since then, important progress has been made with respect to the understanding of the role of the Pten protein in the normal development of the brain as well as in the molecular pathogenesis of human gliomas. This review summarizes the current state of the art concerning the involvement of aberrant Pten function in the development of different biologic features of malignant gliomas, such as loss of cell-cycle control and uncontrolled cell proliferation, escape from apoptosis, brain invasion, and aberrant neoangiogenesis. Most of the tumor-suppressive properties of Pten are dependent on its lipid phosphatase activity, which inhibits the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway through dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate. The additional function of Pten as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase may also play a role in glioma pathogenesis. Besides the wealth of data elucidating the functional roles of Pten, recent studies suggest a diagnostic significance of PTEN gene alterations as a molecular marker for poor prognosis in anaplastic astrocytomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Furthermore, the possibility of selective targeting of PTEN mutant tumor cells by specific pharmacologic inhibitors of members of the Pten/PI3K/Akt pathway opens up new perspectives for a targeted molecular therapy of malignant gliomas.", "events": [{"trigger": "signaling", "event_type": "Pathway"}, {"trigger": "suppressor", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "role", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "role", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "development", "event_type": "Development"}, {"trigger": "aberrant", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "development", "event_type": "Development"}, {"trigger": "uncontrolled", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "proliferation", "event_type": "Cell_proliferation"}, {"trigger": "escape", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "apoptosis", "event_type": "Death"}, {"trigger": "invasion", "event_type": "Localization"}, {"trigger": "aberrant", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "neoangiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "dependent", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "inhibits", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "inhibits", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "signaling pathway", "event_type": "Pathway"}, {"trigger": "dephosphorylation", "event_type": "Dephosphorylation"}, {"trigger": "play a role", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "alterations", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "selective targeting", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "pathway", "event_type": "Pathway"}, {"trigger": "therapy", "event_type": "Planned_process"}]}

After 7 days, the pellets from animals fed the control diet were infiltrated by abundant branching networks of blood vessels with patent lumen-containing RBCs. In contrast, pellets from the CLA-fed animals contained fewer infiltrating cells, which formed limited branching cellular networks, the majority of which had collapsed lumen and no RBCs. Both levels of dietary CLA showed similar effects, with the number of RBC-containing vessels per 20x field decreased to a third of that seen in control.

The initial step of adhesion was mediated by sialyl Lewis(x) (Le(x)) and sialyl Le(a), the carbohydrate determinants expressed on the cancer cells, and E-selectin expressed constitutively on F-2 cells. Prolonged culture led to the implantation of cancer cells into the monolayer of the F-2 cells, which was mediated mainly by alpha(3)beta(1)-integrin. F-2 cells cultured on Matrigel showed evident tube formation, and coculture of F-2 cells with A431 cells led to the formation of A431 cell nests constantly surrounded by tube-like networks consisting of F-2 cells. This in vitro morphogenesis was inhibited by the addition of anti-sialyl Le(x)/Le(a) or anti-beta(1)-integrin antibodies, which led to the formation of cancer cell aggregates that were independent from the F-2 cell networks. This in vitro morphological appearance was exactly reproduced in the in vivo tumors, which were formed when the mixture of A431 and F-2 cells at the ratio of 10:1 were cotransplanted s.c. into the back of nude rats. The tumors of A431 supplemented with F-2 cells were profoundly vascularized throughout by the tubular structures formed by F-2 cells, the lumen of which contained the host rat blood cells.

Destruction of an existing vasculature also directly inflicts serious damage to the tumor cell.

{"text": "The role of organ vascularization and lipoplex-serum initial contact in intravenous murine lipofection.\n\nFollowing intravenous administration of cationic lipid-DNA complexes (lipoplexes) into mice, transfection (lipofection) occurs predominantly in the lungs. This was attributed to high entrapment of lipoplexes in the extended lung vascular tree. To determine whether lipofection in other organs could be enhanced by increasing the degree of vascularization, we used a transgenic mouse model with tissue-specific angiogenesis in liver. Tail vein injection of N-(1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylammonium chloride (DOTAP)/cholesterol lipoplexes resulted in increased lipoplex entrapment in hypervascularized liver but did not boost luciferase expression, suggesting that lipoplex delivery is not a sufficient condition for efficient organ lipofection. Because the intravenously injected lipoplexes migrated within seconds to lungs, we checked whether the effects of immediate contact with serum correlate with lung lipofection efficiency of different DOTAP-based formulations. Under conditions mimicking the injection environment, the lipoplex-serum interaction was strongly dependent on helper lipid and ionic strength: lipoplexes prepared in 150 mM NaCl or lipoplexes with high ( greater than 33 mol%) cholesterol were found to aggregate immediately. This aggregation process was irreversible and was inversely correlated with the percentage of lung cells that took up lipoplexes and with the efficiency of lipofection. No other structural changes in serum were observed for cholesterol-based lipoplexes. Dioleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-based lipoplexes were found to give low expression, apparently because of an immediate loss of integrity in serum, without lipid-DNA dissociation.

BACKGROUND: Although many children with CHD develop pulmonary vascular disease, it is unclear why this complication is reversible after complete repair in some cases but irreversible in others. Because failure of endothelial cell apoptosis might lead to intimal proliferation and lack of reversibility of PHT, we investigated this and other key markers of vasoactivity and angiogenesis in subjects with PHT and CHD. METHODS: We assessed antiapoptotic and proapoptotic markers in vascular and perivascular cells in lung biopsy samples from 18 patients with CHD, 7 with reversible and 11 with irreversible PHT, and 6 control patients. Immunostaining for endothelial nitric oxide synthase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and CD34 (markers of vasoactivity and neoangiogenesis) was also performed. RESULTS: The antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was highly expressed by pulmonary endothelial cells in all cases of irreversible PHT but in no cases of reversible PHT, nor in control patients (p  less than  0.001). Intimal proliferation was present in 10 of 11 irreversible PHT cases, but never observed in reversible PHT (p  less than  0.001). Similarly, perivascular inflammatory T-cells expressed more antiapoptotic proteins in irreversible PHT (p  less than  0.01). Irreversible PHT cases were also more likely to show compensatory upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and new small vessel formation at the sites of native vessel stenosis or occlusion (p  less than  0.001).

Here, we show that gene transfer-induced p75(NTR) expression impairs the survival, proliferation, migration, and adhesion capacities of cultured ECs and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and inhibits angiogenesis in vitro. Moreover, intramuscular p75(NTR) gene delivery impairs neovascularization and blood flow recovery in a mouse model of limb ischemia. These disturbed functions are associated with suppression of signaling mechanisms implicated in EC survival and angiogenesis.

{"text": "Bevacizumab and irinotecan therapy in glioblastoma multiforme: a series of 13 cases.\n\nOBJECT: Endothelial proliferation has been recognized as a marker of high-grade or aggressive glioma. Bevacizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor that has been shown to have activity in malignant gliomas when combined with irinotecan. The authors report on a case series of 13 patients with recurrent heavily pretreated malignant glioma that was treated with the combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan. METHODS: Standard therapy with primary resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation had failed in all patients. The median number of therapies applied, including initial surgery, was 5 (range 3-7 therapies). Nine patients were started on bevacizumab at a dose of 5 mg/m2 every 2 weeks. Four patients received bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/m2; irinotecan was given at a dose of 125 mg/m2 every week for 3 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 13 treated patients, 10 (77%) had a radiologically demonstrated partial response and 3 (23%) had stable disease. Six patients (46%) had a clinical response. The median time to disease progression while on treatment was 24 weeks. The median overall survival was 27 weeks. The disease progressed in 8 patients, despite an initial response. Five patients are still responding to therapy. Six of the 8 patients whose disease progressed have died. Bevacizumab was discontinued in 2 patients because of nonfatal intracranial bleeding.

Commonality exists in the processes involved in vasculature development between tissues whether healthy or diseased. Endosialin/TEM 1 is a cell membrane protein that is expressed in blood vessels during embryogenesis and tumorigenesis but not in normal mature vessels. Antibodies developed to human endosialin were used to investigate endosialin expression and function in human prenatal brain pericytes and pericytes residing in tumors. Anti-endosialin was capable of preventing pericyte tube formation in culture and inhibited migration. Brain pericytes in culture had higher levels of endosialin/TEM 1 than TEMs-2, -3, -4, -5, -7, and -8. Immunocytochemistry revealed that endosialin was present in the cytoplasmic body and in the elongated extensions essential to pericyte function. Transgenic mice engineered to express human endosialin bred on an immunocompromised background allowed the growth of human tumor xenografts. In human colon carcinoma Colo205 and HT29 xenografts grown in human endosialin-transgenic mice, endosialin expression was largely confined to NG2-expressing perivascular cells and not CD31-positive endothelial cells. Similar methods applied to human ovarian and colon tumors confirmed endosialin expression by pericytes. The data indicate that endosialin is strongly expressed by pericytes during periods of active angiogenesis during embryonic and tumor development.

Further tumour inhibition studies showed that STX243 was also active against MCF-7 paclitaxel-resistant tumours. Using a Matrigel plug-based model, in vivo angiogenesis was restricted with STX243 and STX140 (50 and 72%, respectively, using a 10 mg kg(-1) oral dose), thereby showing the antiangiogenic activity of both compounds. The pharmacokinetics of STX243 were examined at two different doses using adult female rats. The compound was orally bioavailable (31% after a single 10 mg kg(-1) dose) and resistant to metabolism.

In this study, we have investigated gene knockdown analysis of endothelial Robos, in particular roundabout 4 (robo4), the predominant Robo in endothelial cells using small interfering RNA technology in vitro. RESULTS: Robo1 and Robo4 knockdown cells display distinct activity in endothelial cell migration assay. The knockdown of robo4 abrogated the chemotactic response of endothelial cells to serum but enhanced a chemokinetic response to Slit2, while robo1 knockdown cells do not display chemotactic response to serum or VEGF. Robo4 knockdown endothelial cells unexpectedly show up regulation of Rho GTPases. Zebrafish Robo4 rescues both Rho GTPase homeostasis and serum reduced chemotaxis in robo4 knockdown cells. Robo1 and Robo4 interact and share molecules such as Slit2, Mena and Vilse, a Cdc42-GAP. In addition, this study mechanistically implicates IRSp53 in the signaling nexus between activated Cdc42 and Mena, both of which have previously been shown to be involved with Robo4 signaling in endothelial cells.

Our group seeks to determine the basic mechanisms underlying ES wound therapy, an area where understanding is currently limited. A feasibility study was carried out to develop the Ahn/Mustoe lapine wound model for systematic investigation of the effects of electrical stimulation on ischemic wound therapy. A standardized surgical procedure incorporated a hybrid stimulation system comprising an implantable mini-stimulator and surface electrodes, with creation of repeatable ischemic wounds. Twenty mature male New Zealand white rabbits (3 kg weight) were employed to evaluate the effects of two empirically selected stimulation paradigms applied continuously for 7-21 days, using each animal as its own control. Outcomes measures included transcutaneous blood gas levels, histology, total RNA content and analysis of alpha2 (I) collagen (COL-I), type IV collagen (COL-IV), alpha1 (V) collagen (COL-V), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression using real-time quantitative PCR. All markers for stimulated wounds showed increased activity relative to non-stimulated control wounds between 7 and 14 days following injury, with peak activity at 14 days. By 21 days post-injury, all activity had returned to near baseline level.

Both COL-I and COL-V showed statistically significant (P  less than  0.05) increased activity between day 7 and day 14 for pattern A, potentially indicating a continued effect on matrix remodeling.

Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is prominently up-regulated in the host-derived vasculature of most tumors, making it an attractive candidate for antiangiogenic intervention. Yet, the net outcome of Ang-2 functions on tumor angiogenesis is believed to be contextual depending on the local cytokine milieu. Correspondingly, Ang-2 manipulatory therapies have been shown to exert protumorigenic as well as antitumorigenic effects. To clarify the role of Ang-2 for angiogenesis and tumor growth in a definite genetic experimental setting, the present study was aimed at comparatively studying the growth of different tumors in wild-type and Ang-2-deficient mice. Lewis lung carcinomas, MT-ret melanomas, and B16F10 melanomas all grew slower in Ang-2-deficient mice. Yet, tumor growth in wild-type and Ang-2-deficient mice dissociated during early stages of tumor development, whereas tumor growth rates during later stages of primary tumor progression were similar. Analysis of the intratumoral vascular architecture revealed no major differences in microvessel density and perfusion characteristics. However, diameters of intratumoral microvessels were smaller in tumors grown in Ang-2-deficient mice, and the vasculature had an altered pattern of pericyte recruitment and maturation. Ang-2-deficient tumor vessels had higher pericyte coverage indices. Recruited pericytes were desmin and NG2 positive and predominately alpha-smooth muscle actin negative, indicative of a more mature pericyte phenotype.

Here, we have tested endocytic Rab GTPases for regulation of VEGFR2 trafficking and signaling linked to endothelial cell migration. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quiescent VEGFR2 displays endosomal localization and colocalization with the Rab5a GTPase, an early endosome fusion regulator. Expression of GTP or GDP-bound Rab5a mutants block activated VEGFR2 trafficking and degradation. Manipulation of Rab7a GTPase activity associated with late endosomes using overexpression of wild-type or mutant proteins blocks activated VEGFR2 trafficking and degradation. Depletion of Rab7a decreased VEGFR2 Y1175 phosphorylation but increased p42/44 (pERK1/2) MAPK phosphorylation. Endothelial cell migration was increased by Rab5a depletion but decreased by Rab7a depletion. CONCLUSIONS: Rab5a and Rab7a regulate VEGFR2 trafficking toward early and late endosomes.

{"text": "Angiogenesis-a novel therapeutic approach for ischemic heart disease.\n\nAngiogenesis is the biologic process of forming new blood vessels. Undoubtedly, blood vessels growth regulation is a vital aspect in health and disease. Under physiological conditions, angiogenesis is regulated by local balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of this process. In many diseases state body loses control over angiogenesis. Angiogenesis-dependent diseases result when new blood vessels either grow excessively or insufficiently. Insufficient angiogenesis occurs in diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke and chronic wounds. Myocardial ischemia both acute and chronic has been clearly shown to stimulate angiogenesis in many experimental models. Therapeutic angiogenesis is the biological agents or bioactive material to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels. Traditional coronary revascularization therapies such as coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery, act by restoring blood flow through the preexisting coronary vessels. One limitation of these approaches, however, may be the failure to normalize myocardial perfusion, due to the concomitant presence or small of resistance vessel disease. In contrast, therapeutic angiogenesis is based on the concept that coronary collateral development may be stimulated by pharmacological or molecular means and can limit myocardial ischemia. Studies, both in human and animal models support the notion that, various angiogenic growth factors and progenitor cells can enhance new blood vessels. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), recombinant proteins and bone marrow stem cells are currently used therapeutic stimulators for angiogenesis.

{"text": "Dopamine regulates phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 by engaging Src-homology-2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2.\n\nVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced receptor phosphorylation is the crucial step for initiating downstream signaling pathways that lead to angiogenesis or related pathophysiological outcomes. Our previous studies have shown that the neurotransmitter dopamine could inhibit VEGF-induced phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR-2), endothelial cell proliferation, migration, microvascular permeability, and thus, angiogenesis. In this study, we address the mechanism by which VEGFR-2 phosphorylation is regulated by dopamine. Here, we demonstrate that D2 dopamine receptor (D2DR) colocalizes with VEGFR-2 at the cell surface. Dopamine pretreatment increases the translocation and colocalization of Src-homology-2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) with D2DR at the cell surface. Dopamine administration leads to increased VEGF-induced phosphorylation of SHP-2 and this increased phosphorylation parallels the increased phosphatase activity of SHP-2.

{"text": "Islet endothelial activation and oxidative stress gene expression is reduced by IL-1Ra treatment in the type 2 diabetic GK rat.\n\nBACKGROUND: Inflammation followed by fibrosis is a component of islet dysfunction in both rodent and human type 2 diabetes. Because islet inflammation may originate from endothelial cells, we assessed the expression of selected genes involved in endothelial cell activation in islets from a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes, the Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rat. We also examined islet endotheliuml/oxidative stress (OS)/inflammation-related gene expression, islet vascularization and fibrosis after treatment with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR on islets isolated from 10-week-old diabetic GK and control Wistar rats. Furthermore, GK rats were treated s.c twice daily with IL-1Ra (Kineret, Amgen, 100 mg/kg/day) or saline, from 4 weeks of age onwards (onset of diabetes). Four weeks later, islet gene analysis and pancreas immunochemistry were performed. Thirty-two genes were selected encoding molecules involved in endothelial cell activation, particularly fibrinolysis, vascular tone, OS, angiogenesis and also inflammation. All genes except those encoding angiotensinogen and epoxide hydrolase (that were decreased), and 12-lipoxygenase and vascular endothelial growth factor (that showed no change), were significantly up-regulated in GK islets. After IL-1Ra treatment of GK rats in vivo, most selected genes implied in endothelium/OS/immune cells/fibrosis were significantly down-regulated. IL-1Ra also improved islet vascularization, reduced fibrosis and ameliorated glycemia.

{"text": "Basic fibroblast growth factor: a missing link between collagen VII, increased collagenase, and squamous cell carcinoma in recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.\n\nBACKGROUND: Patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) have deficiencies of collagen type VII and have elevated levels of fibroblast collagenase, and a greatly increased risk of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Patients with other genetic blistering disorders do not have elevated collagenase or an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma, despite chronic wounding. The connection between collagen type VII deficiency, increased collagenase, and squamous cell carcinoma is not understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine from 81 patients with RDEB (39 patients), junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB; 12 patients), and epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS; 30 patients), as well as unaffected family members of RDEB patients (33 patients), was tested for the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) using a sensitive radioimmunoassay. These patients included many who were enrolled in the Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry and others who were referred by their physicians. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of patients with RDEB had elevated levels ( greater than  5000 pg/g) of urinary bFGF. In contrast, none of the patients with JEB had elevated levels of bFGF. Twenty-one percent of clinically unaffected family members had elevated levels of bFGF, and 13% of patients with EBS had elevated levels of bFGF. The frequency of elevated bFGF values among all groups was statistically significant (p = 0.002), and the levels of bFGF in RDEB patients were significantly elevated compared with those of other groups (p  less than  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We have found that patients with RDEB have elevated levels of bFGF, which may contribute to increased fibroblast collagenase and the development of squamous cell carcinoma. These results suggest a novel treatment for RDEB, namely, angiogenesis inhibitors, which may antagonize the effects of bFGF in this disorder.", "events": [{"trigger": "increased", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "deficiencies", "event_type": "Gene_expression"}, {"trigger": "elevated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "elevated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "increased", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "presence", "event_type": "Localization"}, {"trigger": "elevated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "elevated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "elevated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "elevated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "elevated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "elevated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "elevated", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "increased", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "development", "event_type": "Development"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "antagonize the effects", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}]}

{"text": "Effect of U-995, a potent shark cartilage-derived angiogenesis inhibitor, on anti-angiogenesis and anti-tumor activities.\n\nBACKGROUND: A potent angiogenesis inhibitor, U-995, has been purified from the cartilage of the blue shark (Prionace glauca). U-995 is composed of two single peptides with molecular mass of 10 and 14 kDa, respectively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: U-995 was designed to study human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) migration and proliferation in vitro and angiogenesis induced by TNF alpha in chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). Furthermore, we determined the ability of U-995 to inhibiting tumor cell growth and metastasis. RESULTS: U-995 (15 and 30 micrograms/ml) markedly inhibited HUVEC migration and, at 15-50 micrograms/ml produced a dose-dependent decline in [3H]-thymidine incorporation. 30 and 50 micrograms/ml of U-995, when added to TNF alpha-induced angiogenesis caused discontinuous and disrupted blood vessels. Moreover, U-995 (30 micrograms/ml) markedly prevented collagenase-induced collagenolysis. In addition, when 200 micrograms U-995 was injected i.p. into mice it suppressed sarcoma-180 cell growth and B16-F10 mouse melanoma cell metastasis in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the anti-angiogenic effects of U-995 may be be due to interference with the proliferation and migration of HUVECs as well as inhibition of collagenolysis, thereby leading to inhibition of both angiogenesis and tumor cell growth.", "events": [{"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "activities", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "activities", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "purified", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "migration", "event_type": "Localization"}, {"trigger": "proliferation", "event_type": "Cell_proliferation"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "induced", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "inhibiting", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "inhibiting", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "growth", "event_type": "Cell_proliferation"}, {"trigger": "metastasis", "event_type": "Localization"}, {"trigger": "inhibited", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "migration", "event_type": "Localization"}, {"trigger": "added", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "induced", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "caused", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "disrupted", "event_type": "Breakdown"}, {"trigger": "prevented", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "induced", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "collagenolysis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "injected", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "suppressed", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "suppressed", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "growth", "event_type": "Cell_proliferation"}, {"trigger": "metastasis", "event_type": "Localization"}, {"trigger": "effects", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "due", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "due", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "due", "event_type": "Positive_regulation"}, {"trigger": "interference", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "interference", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "proliferation", "event_type": "Cell_proliferation"}, {"trigger": "migration", "event_type": "Localization"}, {"trigger": "inhibition", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "collagenolysis", "event_type": "Pathway"}, {"trigger": "inhibition", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "inhibition", "event_type": "Negative_regulation"}, {"trigger": "angiogenesis", "event_type": "Blood_vessel_development"}, {"trigger": "growth", "event_type": "Cell_proliferation"}]}
