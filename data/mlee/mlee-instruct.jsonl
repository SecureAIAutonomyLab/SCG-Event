One such factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is considered to exert a potent angiogenic activity, as indicated by immunohistochemical and molecular evidence. In this study we investigated the serum VEGF level (s-VEGF) in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). s-VEGF in peripheral blood samples was analyzed in 40 RCC patients and 40 patients without cancer (controls) using a sandwich enzyme-linked immunoassay. In 20 RCC patients, serum samples were obtained separately from the bilateral renal veins. s-VEGF was also measured before, 4 and 8 weeks after nephrectomy in 11 patients. There were significant differences in s-VEGF between the RCC patients and the controls (207.3+/-32.9 vs. 71.5+/-9.1 pg/ml, mean+/-SE) (P less than 0.005), between the tumor-bearing renal veins and the contralateral ones (P less than 0.01), between the pre- and post-nephrectomy situations (P less than 0.01) and among the various parameters of tumor status such as tumor extent (P less than 0.001) and existence of metastasis (P less than 0.001). s-VEGF significantly correlated with the tumor volume obtained by a three-dimensional measurement (r=0.802, P less than 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity of s-VEGF at the cut-off level of 100 pg/ml, as determined by the receiver-operating-characteristics curve, were 80.0% and 72.5%, respectively. The results indicate that tumor tissue of RCC liberates VEGF into the systemic blood flow and that s-VEGF is a possible marker for RCC.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: Neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: essential, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: regulated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: liberates, Event Type: Localization</s>"}

The mechanisms underlying the initial insulin-induced deterioration of retinal status in patients with diabetes remain unknown. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is known to be operative in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. The current study was conducted to characterize the effect of insulin on retinal VEGF gene expression in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The effect of insulin on VEGF expression in vivo was examined by in situ hybridization studies of rat retinal VEGF transcripts. To examine the mechanisms by which insulin regulates VEGF expression, human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were exposed to insulin, and VEGF mRNA levels were quantified with RNase protection assays (RPAs). Conditioned media from insulin-treated RPE cells were assayed for VEGF protein and capillary endothelial cell proliferation. The capacity of insulin to stimulate the VEGF promoter linked to a luciferase reporter gene was characterized in transient transfection assays. RESULTS: Insulin increased VEGF mRNA levels in the ganglion, inner nuclear, and RPE cell layers. In vitro, insulin increased VEGF mRNA levels in human RPE cells and enhanced VEGF promoter activity without affecting transcript stability. Insulin treatment also increased VEGF protein levels in conditioned RPE cell media in a dose-dependent manner with a median effective concentration of 5 nM. The insulin-conditioned RPE cell media stimulated capillary endothelial cell proliferation, an effect that was completely blocked by anti-VEGF neutralizing antibody. CONCLUSIONS: Insulin increases VEGF mRNA and secreted protein levels in RPE cells through enhanced transcription of the VEGF gene. Intensive insulin therapy may cause a transient worsening of retinopathy in patients with diabetes through increased retinal VEGF gene expression.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: therapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: regulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: assayed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: stimulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: linked, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: transcription, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: therapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression</s>"}

Paraganglioma tissue fragments obtained at surgery from a VHL type 2a patient were transplanted s.c. to male BALB/c nu/nu (nude) mice: (a) 2-3-mm fragments for \"prevention\" experiments; and (b) 2-3-mm fragments allowed to grow to 1 cm for \"intervention\" studies. Both groups received either 0.5 mg/ml linomide in drinking water or acidified water and were followed until tumor diameter reached 3 cm or for 4 weeks. In both the prevention and intervention experiments, a significant diminution of tumor size and weight was observed in the drug-treated animals. In vivo nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of tumor blood flow in linomide-treated animals showed localization of blood vessels almost exclusively to the periphery of the poorly vascularized tumors with a significant reduction of both vascular functionality and vasodilation. Histological examination of tumors from linomide-treated animals revealed marked avascularity. Treated animals also displayed a 2.4-fold reduction of tumor vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA levels. Taken together, our data indicate that in VHL disease, therapy directed at inhibition of constitutively expressed VEGF induction of angiogenesis by VHL tumors may constitute an effective medical treatment.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: obtained, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: transplanted, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: diminution, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: localization, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

These changes originate from increased peritoneal surface area, but the morphologic and molecular mechanisms involved remain unknown. The hypothesis that modifications of activity and/or expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isozymes might play a role in these modifications, via enhanced local production of nitric oxide, was tested in this study. NOS activities were measured by the L-citrulline assay in peritoneal biopsies from seven control subjects, eight uremic patients immediately before the onset of PD, and 13 uremic patients on short-term ( less than 18 mo, n = 6) or long-term( greater than 18 mo, n = 7) PD. Peritoneal NOS activity is increased fivefold in long-term PD patients compared with control subjects. In uremic patients, NOS activity is positively correlated with the duration of PD. Increased NOS activity is mediated solely by Ca(2+)-dependent NOS and, as shown by immunoblotting, an upregulation of endothelial NOS. The biologic relevance of increased NOS in long-term PD was demonstrated by enhanced nitrotyrosine immunoreactivity and a significant increase in vascular density and endothelial area in the peritoneum. Immunoblotting and immunostaining studies demonstrated an upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mostly along the endothelium lining peritoneal blood vessels in long-term PD patients. In the latter, VEGF colocalized with the advanced glycation end product pentosidine deposits. These data provide a morphologic (angiogenesis and increased endothelial area) and molecular (enhanced NOS activity and endothelial NOS upregulation) basis for explaining the permeability changes observed in long-term PD. They also support the implication of local advanced glycation end product deposits and liberation of VEGF in that process.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: play a role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Synthesis;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: Increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: upregulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: upregulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: colocalized, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: upregulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: liberation, Event Type: Localization</s>"}

However, its widespread application has been hampered by difficulties in the large-scale production of the antiangiogenic proteins. This limitation may be resolved by in vivo delivery and expression of the antiangiogenic genes. We have constructed a recombinant adenovirus that expresses murine endostatin that is biologically active both in vitro, as determined in endothelial cell proliferation assays, and in vivo, by suppression of angiogenesis induced by vascular endothelial growth factor 165. Persistent high serum levels of endostatin (605-1740 ng/ml; mean, 936 ng/ml) were achieved after systemic administration of the vector to nude mice, which resulted in significant reduction of the growth rates and the volumes of JC breast carcinoma and Lewis lung carcinoma (P  less than  0.001 and P  less than  0.05, respectively). In addition, the endostatin vector treatment completely prevented the formation of pulmonary micrometastases in Lewis lung carcinoma (P = 0.0001). Immunohistochemical staining of the tumors demonstrated a decreased number of blood vessels in the treatment group versus the controls. In conclusion, the present study clearly demonstrates the potential of vector-mediated antiangiogenic gene therapy as a component in cancer therapy.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: gene transfer, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: results, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: results, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: results, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastases, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: therapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: constructed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expresses, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: suppression, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: administration, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: vector treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: prevented, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: therapy, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

A cohort of unspecified mesodermal cells differentiates into primitive endothelial cells, which migrate to and occupy positions within the stereotypical blueprint of the primitive vasculature. Once in position, these cells coalesce and form cords, which lumenize and become ensheathed by supporting pericytes and smooth muscle cells. This primitive vascular network is extensively remodeled in some places, and expanded by sprouting in others. Various studies using the mouse, quail/chick, and frog have uncovered a number of signals that guide these complex processes but many gaps still exist in our understanding of the mechanisms by which the embryonic vasculature is built. Because many questions will require in vivo studies to be properly addressed, the zebrafish, with its unique accessibility to analysis by combined embryological, molecular, and genetic methods, should prove invaluable in identifying new molecules involved in blood vessel development and integrating pathways that influence embryonic blood vessel formation.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Building, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: develops, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: differentiates, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: migrate, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: coalesce, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: form, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: lumenize, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: ensheathed, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: ensheathed, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: remodeled, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: built, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development</s>"}

This process is necessary for the growth and metastasis of tumors, and considerable effort is being expended to find inhibitors of tumor angiogenesis. This usually involves screening of potential anti-angiogenic compounds on endothelial cells. To this end, two candidate anti-angiogenic RNA-damaging agents, onconase and (-4)rhEDN, were screened for their effects on endothelial cell proliferation using three distinct types of endothelial cells in culture: HPV-16 E6/E7-immortalized human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), a Kras-transformed HPV-16 E6/E7 HUVEC (Rhim et al., Carcinogenesis 4, 673-681, 1998), and primary HUVECs. Onconase similarly inhibited proliferation in all three cell lines (IC(50) = 0.3-1.0 microM) while (-4)rhEDN was more effective on immortalized HUVEC cell lines (IC(50) = 0.02-0.06 microM) than on primary HUVECs (IC(50) > 0.1 microM).

Although in vivo studies have shown that such inhibition stems from complex interactions of immune cells and the production of IFN-gamma and other downstream angiostatic chemokines, the mechanisms involved are still poorly defined. Here we show that IL-12 activates an anti-angiogenic program in Con A-activated mouse spleen cells (activated spc) or human PBMC (activated PBMC). The soluble factors they release in its presence arrest the cycle of endothelial cells (EC), inhibit in vitro angiogenesis, negatively modulate the production of matrix metalloproteinase-9, and the ability of EC to adhere to vitronectin and up-regulate ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. These effects do not require direct cell-cell contact, yet result from continuous interaction between activated lymphoid cells and EC. We used neutralizing Abs to show that the IFN-inducible protein-10 and monokine-induced by IFN-gamma chemokines are pivotal in inducing these effects. Experiments with nu/nu mice, nonobese diabetic-SCID mice, or activated spc enriched in specific cell subpopulations demonstrated that CD4(+), CD8(+), and NK cells are all needed to mediate the full anti-angiogenetic effect of IL-12.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: activates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: program, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: arrest, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: negatively modulate, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: negatively modulate, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: adhere, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: up-regulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: up-regulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: require, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: contact, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediate, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation</s>"}

To elucidate the biological role of the endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor thrombospondin-2 (TSP-2) during multistep carcinogenesis, we subjected TSP-2-deficient and wild-type mice to a chemical skin carcinogenesis regimen. Surprisingly, TSP-2 expression was strongly upregulated in the mesenchymal stroma of wild-type mice throughout the consecutive stages of tumorigenesis whereas the angiogenesis factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, was induced predominantly in tumor cells. TSP-2 deficiency dramatically enhanced susceptibility to skin carcinogenesis and resulted in accelerated and increased tumor formation. The angiogenic switch occurred in early stages of pre-malignant tumor formation, and tumor angiogenesis was significantly enhanced in TSP-2-deficient mice. While TSP-2 deficiency did not affect tumor differentiation or proliferation, tumor cell apoptosis was significantly reduced. These results reveal upregulation of an endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor during multi step tumorigenesis and identify enhanced stromal TSP-2 expression as a novel host anti-tumor defense mechanism.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: defense, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibitor, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: subjected, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: deficient, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: upregulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: deficiency, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: deficient, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: deficiency, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: affect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: affect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: differentiation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: apoptosis, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: defense, Event Type: Negative_regulation</s>"}

The aim of the present study was to clarify how expression of p53 protein participates in angiogenesis, and whether the coexpression of VEGF and p53 protein has a significance for angiogenesis and the clinicopathological features in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: Tissues samples were taken from 60 patients with esophageal SCC after surgery. The expression of VEGF and p53 protein in these SCC was examined immunohistochemically. Microvessel density (MVD) was determined by counting microvessels in tumor sections stained for Factor VIII-related antigen. Ki-67 labeling index (LI) was calculated, based on Ki-67 antigen immunostaining, as a proliferative marker. Apoptotic index (AI) was calculated, based on the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end labeling, to evaluate apoptosis. RESULTS: VEGF expression was observed in 58.3%, and p53 protein expression was observed in 61.7% of the 60 patients. VEGF and p53 protein were significantly coexpressed in 26 (43.4%). Histological venous invasion (p  less than  0.01) and distant metastasis (p  less than  0.05) were significantly correlated with p53 protein expression. The two parameters were more frequently observed in the SCC with VEGF/p53 coexpression than in those without the coexpression. The MVD and Ki-67 LI were significantly higher (p  less than  0.01 and p  less than  0.001), and the AI was significantly lower (p  less than  0.001) in the SCC with p53 protein expression than in the SCC without it.

In this report we studied the effects of SFLLR, an agonist of the activated thrombin receptor and thrombin receptor peptide and non peptide antagonists on angiogenesis in the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) system. As antagonists were used the tripeptide FPR and non-peptide 1,4-disubstituted piperazine derivatives. The pentapeptide SFLLR, like thrombin, caused a marked stimulation of angiogenesis in the CAM. FPR and the piperazine derivatives caused suppression of angiogenesis and in combination with thrombin antagonized its angiogenic effect. Thrombin and SFLLR activated progelatinase A (MMP-2) in the culture medium of human umbilical cord endothelial cells (HUVECs).

SPARC (secreted protein, acidic, and rich in cysteine) is a matrix-associated glycoprotein that modulates the adhesion and proliferation of vascular cells. In this study, we demonstrate that SPARC inhibits human arterial smooth muscle cell proliferation stimulated by platelet-derived growth factor or by adhesion to monomeric type I collagen. Binding studies with SPARC and SPARC peptides indicate specific and saturable interaction with smooth muscle cells that involves the C-terminal Ca2+-binding region of the protein. We also report that SPARC arrests monomeric collagen-supported smooth muscle cell proliferation in the late G1-phase of the cell cycle in the absence of an effect on cell shape or on levels of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. Cyclin-dependent kinase-2 activity, p107 and cyclin A levels, and retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation are markedly reduced in response to the addition of exogenous SPARC and/or peptides derived from specific domains of SPARC. Thus, SPARC, previously characterized as an inhibitor of platelet-derived growth factor binding to its receptor, also antagonizes smooth muscle cell proliferation mediated by monomeric collagen at the level of cyclin-dependent kinase-2 activity.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: independent, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: independent, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: Interactions, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: regulate, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: Binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: Binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: arrests, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: supported, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: response, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: response, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: response, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: response, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: addition, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: antagonizes, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation</s>"}

Overexpression of NRP1 by prostate tumor cells in vivo results in increased tumor angiogenesis and growth. We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying NRP1-mediated angiogenesis by analyzing the association of NRP1 and KDR. An intracellular complex containing NRP1 and KDR was immunoprecipitated from EC by anti-NRP1 antibodies only in the presence of VEGF165. In contrast, VEGF121, which does not bind to NRP1, did not support complex formation. Complexes containing VEGF165, NRP1, and KDR were also formed in an intercellular fashion by co-culture of EC expressing KDR only, with cells expressing NRP1 only, for example, breast carcinoma cells. VEGF165 also mediated the binding of a soluble NRP1 dimer to cells expressing KDR only, confirming the formation of such complexes. Furthermore, the formation of complexes containing KDR and NRP1 markedly increased 125I-VEGF165 binding to KDR. Our results suggest that formation of a ternary complex of VEGF165, KDR, and NRP1 potentiates VEGF165 binding to KDR.

Cancer cells secrete soluble factors which can induce proliferation and migration of capillary endothelial cells. Among the most potent of the angiogenic factors is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Increased VEGF expression by malignant tumors has been associated with high vascularity, increased cancer cell growth, and lymph node metastasis. Reduced oxygen tension has been shown to increase VEGF production by induction of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha). The mechanisms by which hypoxic tumor environments induce HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression are largely unknown. Jun N terminal kinase (JNK1) and p38 kinase are activated by a variety of stress stimuli. To determine if hypoxic activation of these stress activated protein kinases regulated HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression, we assayed JNK1 and p38 activity in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines grown under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia rapidly induced both JNK1 and p38 activity in these cells. This activation correlated with induction of HIF-1alpha expression and DNA binding activity which was blocked by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Hypoxia also increased VEGF production by SCC lines, which was inhibited by treatment with SB203580. Overexpression of JNK1 or p38 was sufficient to induce HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression.

The stromal fibrous reaction associated to infiltrating carcinomas is responsible of focal increased density, and architectural distorsion, ultrasound acoustic shadowing; abnormal neoangiogenesis can be detected by Doppler, CT or MR imaging. Invasive carcinomas without spiculated margins are poorly differentiated tumors. Mammographic patterns of microcalcifications depend on their physiopathological process (necrosis, secretion), and the shape of clusters (round, triangular) typifies their anatomical site of origin (lobular, ductal). Less frequent lesions (invasive lobular, mucinous, and medullary carcinomas, radial scar) will be also explained based on radiopathological correlations. Knowledge of radiopathological correlations in breast diseases helps the radiologists to analyze and characterize breast lesions.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: infiltrating, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: neoangiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Invasive, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: differentiated, Event Type: Development</s>"}

To further clarify the influence of mechanical strain on the regulation of bone formation, bone growth factors (insulin-like growth factor [IGF] I, IGF binding protein [IGFBP] 3, transforming growth factor [TGF] beta1, and basic FGF [bFGF]), bone matrix degrading enzymes (matrix-metalloproteinases [MMPs] 1, 2, and 3), human growth hormone (hGH), and bone formation markers (ALP, bone-specific ALP [BAP], and osteocalcin [OC]) have been analyzed in serum samples from 10 patients in each group pre- and postoperatively. In the distraction group, a significant postoperative increase in MMP-1, bFGF, ALP, and BAP could be observed during the lengthening and the consolidation period when compared with the baseline levels. Osteotomy fracture healing without the traction stimulus failed to induce a corresponding increase in these factors. In addition, comparison of both groups revealed a significantly higher increase in TGF-beta1, IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and hGH in the lengthening group during the distraction period, indicating key regulatory functions in mechanotransduction. The time courses of changes in MMP-1, bone growth factors (TGF-beta1 and bFGF), and hGH, respectively, correlated significantly during the lengthening phase, indicating common regulatory pathways for these factors in distraction osteogenesis. Significant correlation between the osteoblastic marker BAP, TGF-beta1, and bFGF suggests strain-activated osteoblastic cells as a major source of systemically increased bone growth factors during callus distraction. The systemic increase in bFGF and MMP-1 might reflect an increased local stimulation of angiogenesis during distraction osteogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

DESIGN: Experimental study and interventional case series. METHODS: The parameters associated with locating and then photocoagulating CNV feeder vessels were identified and optimized using published data and data derived from modeling the choroidal vasculature. Based on these optimized parameters, a prototype diagnostic/treatment system was designed that captures high-speed indocyanine green (ICG) angiogram images and facilitates analysis of the images by enhancing visualization of dye movement through CNV feeder vessels (FVs). The system also permits precise aiming and delivery of 810- nm wavelength photocoagulation laser energy to target FVs on a real-time ICG angiogram image of the choroidal vasculature. Target FVs are tracked by a joy-stick controlled laser aiming beam until an intravenously-injected high-concentration ICG dye bolus is observed to enter the target vessel, at which time the laser is fired. Proof of principle of the combined diagnosis/treatment system design for performing dye-enhanced photocoagulation (DEP) in the clinical setting and determination of the minimum DEP laser energy needed to close CNV FVs was made in 11 AMD patients requiring treatment of CNV, but for whom other treatment was not appropriate. RESULTS: Using ICG-DEP, CNV feeder vessels were closed with single pulse laser energy, delivering as little as 0.6 to 1.8 J of energy to the fundus, producing no visible change in the fundus. Successful FV closure was usually indicated immediately by presence of incarcerated ICG dye in the vessel adjacent to the burn site. The prototype system proved relatively easy to operate. After acquiring and interpreting diagnostic angiograms and repositioning a patient in front of the device, feeder vessel DEP and treatment evaluation required 15 to 20 minutes.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: degeneration, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: treating, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: degeneration, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: photocoagulating, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: intravenously-injected, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: observed, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: requiring, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: closed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: closure, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

METHODS: Forty-one patients (41 eyes) with a clinical diagnosis of exudative ARMD with PED underwent simultaneous fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, also under high (10 degrees ) magnification. Vascular abnormalities in the retina were compared between patients with vascularized (n = 34, group 1) and nonvascularized (n = 7, group 2) PED on indocyanine green angiography and correlated with the size of the PED and the presence of serous retinal detachment. RESULTS: In all, 67 vascular abnormalities were found by indocyanine green angiography and only 22 by fluorescein angiography; this finding was statistically significant (P  less than  0.0001). The finding of retinal vasculopathy (32 patients in group 1 and two patients in group 2) was directly correlated with the presence of choroidal neovascularizations (P = 0.002). There was also a direct correlation between the presence of choroidal neovascularization and size of the PED (P = 0.03).

Up-regulation of MMP activity, favoring proteolytic degradation of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix, has been linked to tumor growth and metastasis, as well as tumor-associated angiogenesis, whereas inhibition of MMP activity appears to restrict these processes. We have used retroviral-mediated gene delivery to effect sustained autocrine expression of TIMP-3 in murine neuroblastoma and melanoma tumor cells in order to further examine the ability of TIMPs to inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. Growth of both histologic types of gene-modified tumor cells in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice was significantly restricted when compared with controls. Grossly, these tumors were small and had few feeding vessels. Histologic evaluation revealed that although tumors overexpressing TIMP-3 had an increased number of CD31(+) endothelial cells, these endothelial cells had not formed functional tubules, as evidenced by decreased vessel continuity and minimal pericyte recruitment. This effect appears to be mediated, in part, by decreased expression of vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin by endothelial cells in the presence of TIMP-3 as seen both in an in vitro assay and in TIMP-3-overexpressing tumors. Taken together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of TIMP-3 can inhibit angiogenesis and associated tumor growth, and that the antiangiogenic effects of TIMP-3 appear to be mediated through the inhibition of functional capillary morphogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Enforced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: morphogenesis, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: maintained, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: maintained, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: Up-regulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: restrict, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: restrict, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: restrict, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: restricted, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: overexpressing, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: formed, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: recruitment, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: overexpressing, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: morphogenesis, Event Type: Development</s>"}

FGF2-stimulated microvessel formation was inhibited by sequestration of FGF2 via addition of soluble FGF receptor (FGFR) chimera protein or anti-FGF2 antibodies. FGFR1 and FGFR2 were present on explants. Levels of FGFR1, but not FGFR2, were increased in embryonic aorta cultured under 5% O(2) relative to room air.

We investigated the mechanism by which ephrin-B1 promotes membrane ruffling in human aortic endothelial cells, because membrane ruffling heralds cell body migration. We especially focused on the role of Crk adaptor protein in EphB-mediated signaling. Using DsRed-tagged Crk and a fluorescent time-lapse microscope, we showed that Crk was recruited to the nascent focal complex after ephrin-B1 stimulation. Furthermore, we found that p130(Cas), but not paxillin, recruited Crk to the nascent focal complex. The necessity of Crk in ephrin-B1-induced membrane ruffling was shown both by the overexpression of dominant negative Crk mutants and by the depletion of Crk by using RNA interference. Then, we examined the role of two major downstream molecules of Crk, Rac1 and Rap1. The dominant negative mutant of Rac1 completely inhibited ephrin-B1-induced membrane ruffling and focal complex assembly. In contrast, rap1GAPII, a negative regulator of Rap1, did not inhibit ephrin-B1-induced membrane ruffling. However, in rap1GAPII-expressing cells, ephrin-B1 did not induce membrane spreading, probably due to instability of the focal complex. These results indicated that Crk plays a critical role in Rac1-induced membrane ruffling and Rap1-mediated nascent focal complex stabilization contributing to ephrin-B1-induced human aortic endothelial cells migration.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: ruffling, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: assembly, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: essential, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: essential, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: vasculogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: play a pivotal role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: play a pivotal role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: ruffling, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: ruffling, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: tagged, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: recruited, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: recruited, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: recruited, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: recruited, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: necessity, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: ruffling, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: depletion, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: ruffling, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: assembly, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: ruffling, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: expressing, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: spreading, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: plays a critical role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: plays a critical role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: ruffling, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: stabilization, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: contributing, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization</s>"}

Our previous in vitro studies in a rat model indicated that insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is a potent angiogenic agent for fetal lung endothelial cells. To assess its role on human vascular lung development, we first examined the expression of IGF-I/II and IGF receptor type I (IGF-IR) in human embryonic and fetal lung tissues at 4-12 wk of gestation. Immunohistochemical and in situ hybridization studies revealed the presence of IGF-I/II-IGF-IR ligands and mRNA transcripts in embryonic lungs as early as 4 wk gestation. Immunotargeting using an anti-IGF-IR neutralizing antibody on human fetal lung explants demonstrated a significant blockade of IGF-IR signaling. Inactivation of IGF-IR resulted in a loss of endothelial cells, accompanied by dramatic changes in fetal lung explant morphology. Terminal transferase dUTP end-labeling assay and TEM studies of anti-IGF-IR-treated lungs demonstrated numerous apoptotic mesenchymal cells. Rat embryonic lung explant studies further validated the importance of the IGF-IGF-IR system for lung vascular development. These data provide the first demonstration of IGF-I/II expression in the human lung in early gestation and indicate that the IGF family of growth factors, acting through the IGF-IR, is required as a survival factor during normal human lung vascularization.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: vasculogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: presence, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: presence, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: presence, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: presence, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: presence, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: presence, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Immunotargeting, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: blockade, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: Inactivation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: loss, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: apoptotic, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: importance, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: system, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: acting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

Aberrant angiogenesis is often associated with lesion formation in chronic periodontitis. The aim of the present study was to investigate the properties of VEGF expression in human gingival fibroblasts (HGF) culture. HGF were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), vesicle (Ve) and outer membrane protein (OMP) from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. HGF constitutively produced VEGF and levels were significantly enhanced (P  less than  0.01) by stimulation with Ve and OMP from A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis at concentrations of 10 microg/ml or higher. On the other hand, VEGF levels were not increased by LPS stimulation. VEGF mRNA expression was also observed in Ve- and OMP-stimulated HGF. A vascular permeability enhancement (VPE) assay was performed using guinea pigs to ascertain whether supernatant from cultures of Ve- and OMP-stimulated HGF enhance vascular permeability in vivo. Supernatant from cultures of Ve- and OMP-stimulated HGF strongly induced VPE. This was markedly suppressed upon simultaneous injection of anti-VEGF polyclonal antibodies with the supernatant. Heating and protease treatment of the stimulants reduced the VEGF enhancing levels in Ve and OMP in vitro. These results suggest that Ve and OMP may be crucial heat-labile and protease-sensitive components of periodontal pathogens that enhance VEGF expression. In addition, VEGF might be associated with the etiology of periodontitis in its early stages according to neovascularization stimulated by periodontal pathogens causing swelling and edema.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: inducer, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Aberrant, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: produced, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhancement, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhance, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: enhancing, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhance, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhance, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation</s>"}

This may explain why some patients remain without symptoms or signs of ischemia. The term \"arteriogenesis\" was introduced to differentiate the formation of collateral arteries from angiogenesis, which mainly occurs in the ischemic, collateral flow-dependent tissue. Many observations in various animal models and humans support that the remodeling of preexisting collateral vessels is the mechanism of collateral artery formation. This remodeling process seems to be mainly flow-mediated. It involves endothelial cell activation, basal membrane degradation, leukocyte invasion, proliferation of vascular cells, neointima formation (in most species studied), and changes of the extracellular matrix. The contribution of ischemia to arteriogenesis is still unclear, but arteriogenesis clearly can occur in the absence of any significant ischemia. It is questionable, whether collateral arteries also form de novo in ischemic vascular diseases. A better understanding of the mechanisms of arteriogenesis will be important for the design of more effective strategies for the treatment of patients with ischemic vascular diseases.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Arteriogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: arteriogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: arteriogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: arteriogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: form, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: arteriogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

We investigated the roles of the prostaglandin synthases cyclooxygenase (COX) I and COX-II in angiogenesis and progesterone production in the newly formed CL, using inhibitors of the COX enzymes and the gonadotropin-induced pseudopregnant rat as a model. Injection of indomethacin, a nonselective COX inhibitor, on the day of ovulation and the following day decreased serum levels of progesterone, as did injection of the selective COX-II inhibitor NS-398. In contrast, a selective COX-I inhibitor, SC-560, had no effect on serum progesterone concentrations. None of the inhibitors had any effect on the weight of the superovulated ovaries or on the synthesis of progesterone by cultured luteal cells. To determine whether changes in angiogenesis are responsible for the decrease in progesterone synthesis, we measured hemoglobin and CD34 levels in luteinized ovaries following injection of COX inhibitors and measured the relative frequency of cells positive for platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule as a specific marker for endothelial cells. All of these parameters were reduced by the COX-II inhibitors, suggesting that changes in the vasculature are responsible for the decrease in serum progesterone. Histological examination of ovarian corrosion casts indicated that NS-398 inhibited the establishment of luteal capillary vessels following the injection of hCG. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the activity of COX-II is associated with the formation of functional CL via its stimulation of angiogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Synthesis;\nTrigger: formed, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: pseudopregnant, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: Injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: synthesis, Event Type: Synthesis;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: responsible, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decrease, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: synthesis, Event Type: Synthesis;\nTrigger: luteinized, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: responsible, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decrease, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: establishment, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

To understand the mechanisms behind these processes, we have examined the effect of FVIIa on apoptosis. Serum deprivation-induced apoptosis of BHK(+TF) cells was characterized by apoptotic blebs, nuclei with chromatin-condensed bodies, DNA degradation, and activation of caspase 3. FVIIa markedly decreased the number of cells with apoptotic morphology and prevented the DNA degradation as measured by means of TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). The antiapoptotic effect of FVIIa was confirmed by the observation that FVIIa attenuated caspase 3 activation. FVIIa-induced antiapoptotic effect was dependent on its proteolytic activity and TF but independent of factor Xa and thrombin. FVIIa-induced cell survival correlated with the activation of Akt and was inhibited markedly by the specific PI3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002. Blocking the activation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) by the specific mitogen-induced extracellular kinase (MEK) inhibitor, U0126, impaired modestly the ability of FVIIa to promote cell survival. In conclusion, FVIIa binding to TF provided protection against apoptosis induced by growth factor deprivation, primarily through activation of PI3-kinase/Akt pathway, and to a lesser extent, p44/42 MAPK pathway.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: apoptosis, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: attenuated, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: survival, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: Blocking, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: impaired, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: survival, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: pathway, Event Type: Pathway</s>"}

METHODS: Corneas of 105 rabbits were infected with viable yeast cells of C. albicans (2.5 x 10(5)). After a 48-hour incubation period, seven groups of animals were treated for 21 days with fluconazole, with group I acting as a control, and groups II to VII receiving adjunct therapy with the corticosteroid prednisolone (5 or 10 times daily; 3, 9, or 15 days after infection). The degree of corneal infiltration, ulceration, corneal clouding, hypopyon, conjunctivitis, neovascularization, and corneal perforation was monitored over a 24-day period, as well as recultivation and resistance to fluconazole of the C. albicans pathogen. RESULTS: The control group showed the highest level of corneal clouding and neovascularization. In comparison, by day 24, the majority of groups also treated with prednisolone displayed significantly less corneal clouding and neovascularization. An immediate decrease in corneal clouding was observed in groups treated with additional low- or high-dose prednisolone from day 9 after inoculation. After additional prednisolone treatment from day 9 or 15 after inoculation, no significant difference was detected in the recultivation rate of C. albicans compared with the control. Early administration of prednisolone (day 3, low and high dose) resulted in the recultivation of significantly more C. albicans. CONCLUSIONS: Fluconazole plus adjunct high-dose prednisolone treatment was most effective when administered 9 days after infection. The delayed application of corticosteroids after treatment with antimycotic drugs in cases of fungal keratitis is therefore not contraindicated and may be beneficial in patients.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: therapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: infiltration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: recultivation, Event Type: Reproduction;\nTrigger: administration, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: recultivation, Event Type: Reproduction;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: application, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

Angiogenesis is a critical process in solid tumor growth and metastasis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a recently identified growth factor with significant angiogenic properties, may be a major tumor angiogenesis regulator. Few studies have investigated the association between p53 and VEGF expressions and prognosis in esophageal carcinoma. Forty-seven specimens resected from patients with stage II and III squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the esophagus were studied using immunohistochemical staining. VEGF and p53 expressions were observed in 40% and 53% of the tumors, respectively. The p53 and VEGF staining statuses were coincident in only 21% of the tumors, and no significant correlation was found between p53 and VEGF statuses. No clinicopathologic factors were significantly correlated with p53 or VEGF expression. No significant association between p53 and VEGF expressions and poor prognosis was found.

The aim of this study is to compare behavior and tissue response between two new polyester prostheses and a commonly used polypropylene (PP) mesh. The polyester prostheses utilized were polyester flat (PF) and polyester soft three-dimensional (PS); the PP mesh utilized was Marlex. Eight randomly assigned 4 x 4-cm2 pieces of two different meshes were fixed in the preperitoneal space with a centrally placed single suture. Gross evaluation included shrinkage and stiffness. Histological evaluation included amount of fibrous and fat encapsulation, connective tissue, foreign-body reaction, neovascularization, hemorrhage, necrosis, and exudate. Evaluations were graded on a zero to four scale. The area and the area ratio were measured using a calibrated micrometer.

The aim of this study was to address the role of pro- and anti-angiogenic molecules in diabetic retinopathy in the aqueous humor of the eye. Aqueous humor was collected at cataract surgery from 19 diabetic patients and from 13 age- and sex-matched normoglycemic controls. Levels of pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiogenic inhibitor pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) were determined. Angiogenic activity of the aqueous humor was quantified by measuring its effect on the migration of capillary endothelial cells. In the aqueous fluid, VEGF levels were increased in diabetics (mean values: 501 vs. 367 pg/ml; p = 0.05), compared to controls. PEDF was found to be decreased in diabetics (mean values: 2080 vs. 5780 ng/ml; p = 0.04) compared to controls. In seven diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy, the most profound finding was a significant decrease of the PEDF level (mean value: 237 ng/ml), whereas VEGF levels were comparable to diabetic patients without proliferation (mean value: 3153; p = 0.003). Angiogenic activity in samples of patients from the control group was generally inhibitory due to PEDF, and inhibition was blocked by neutralizing antibodies to PEDF. Likewise, in diabetics without proliferation, angiogenic activity was also blocked by antibodies to PEDF. We will demonstrate here that the level of the natural ocular anti-angiogenic agent PEDF is inversely associated with proliferative retinopathy. PEDF is an important negative regulator of angiogenic activity of aqueous humor. Our data may have implications for the development of novel regimens for diabetic retinopathy.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: collected, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decrease, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: Angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibitory, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: negative regulator, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

Here we report that CCL16 activates an angiogenic program in vascular endothelial cells by activating CCR1. CCL16 induces dose-dependent random and directional migration of endothelial cells isolated from large vessels and liver capillaries without inducing their proliferation. It also promotes endothelial differentiation into capillary-like structures in an in vitro assay and is angiogenic in the chick chorionallantoic membrane. These angiogenic activities are neutralized by a specific antibody against CCL16. The direct angiogenic activity of CCL16 is further amplified by its ability to prime endothelium to a mitogen signal induced by vascular endothelial growth factor A and to raise their basal production of CXCL8 and CCL2, 2 other angiogenic chemokines. BX471 (R-N-[5-chloro-2-[2-[4(4-fluorophenyl) methyl]-2-methyl-1-piperazinyl]-2-oxoethoxy]phenyl] urea hydrochloric acid salt), a CCR1 antagonist, inhibits angiogenic properties of CCL16, whereas blocking of CCR8 or desensitizing CCR2, which are both well known receptors for CCL16, did not abolish endothelial activation. CCL16 may be specifically cross-linked to CCR1 expressed on endothelial cells. The largely restricted CCL16 expression in the liver suggests that this chemokine may play a role in hepatic vascular formation during development and in angiogenesis associated to hepatic diseases.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: activates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: regulating, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: trafficking, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: injured, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: positively, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: negatively regulate, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: activates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: activating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inducing, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: differentiation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: neutralized, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: raise, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: raise, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: blocking, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: desensitizing, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: abolish, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: abolish, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: restricted, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: may play a role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

Inhibition of the endothelial cell autocrine angiotensin system, with either the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril or the angiotensin II receptor antagonist sar1, ile8-angiotensin II, leads to increased endothelial cell migration and urokinase-like plasminogen activator (u-PA) activity (Bell, L., and J. A. Madri. 1990. Am. J. Pathol. 137:7-12). Inhibition of the autocrine angiotensin system with the converting-enzyme inhibitor or the receptor antagonist also leads to increased expression of the proto-oncogene c-src: pp60c-src mRNA increased 7-11-fold, c-src protein 3-fold, and c-src kinase activity 2-3-fold. Endothelial cell expression of c-src was constitutively elevated after stable infection with a retroviral vector containing the c-src coding sequence. Constitutively increased c-src kinase activity reconstituted the increases in migration and u-PA observed with angiotensin system interruption. Antisera to bovine u-PA blocked the increase in migration associated with increased c-src expression. These data suggest that increases in endothelial cell migration and plasminogen activator after angiotensin system inhibition are at least partially pp60c-src mediated. Elevated c-src expression with angiotensin system inhibition may act to enhance intimal wound closure and to reduce luminal thrombogenicity in vivo.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: system, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: modulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: system, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: system, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: elevated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: system, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: interruption, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: system, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: Elevated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: system, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation</s>"}

Nine eyes of nine consecutive patients with CSCR had two or more leaking points within a macular detachment, one of which was foveal or near to the fovea. Photocoagulation with green argon laser was performed in all eyes, treating all the leaking points except for the central one. Visual symptoms regressed after treatment, and the serous detachment was resolved 10 days to 4 weeks after photocoagulation in all cases. Fluorescein angiography showed no leakage at either the central leakage point or the leakage point that had been treated. These results led us to believe that the central or dependent leak in our cases was not sufficient to maintain the serous detachment by itself. An alternative hypothesis is that the untreated leak did not represent real fluid movement but only diffusion of fluorescein molecules, or a false leak. In cases of CSCR with multiple leaks within a single macular detachment, we believe that a foveal leak may be a dependent or false leak and that direct treatment is not necessary.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: stimulating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: detachment, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: detachment, Event Type: Breakdown</s>"}

Tie1 is an orphan tyrosine kinase receptor expressed almost exclusively in endothelial cells and is required for normal vascular development and maintenance. The present study demonstrates that Tie1 expression is rapidly down-regulated in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress, and more so to shear stress changes. This down-regulation is accompanied by a rapid cleavage of Tie1 and binding of the cleaved Tie1 45 kDa endodomain to Tie2. The rapid cleavage of Tie1 is followed by a transcriptional down-regulation in response to shear stress. The activity of the Tie1 promoter is suppressed by shear stress and by tumor necrosis factor alpha. Shear stress-induced transcriptional suppression of Tie1 is mediated by a negative shear stress response element, localized in a region of 250 bp within the promoter. The rapid down-regulation of Tie1 by shear stress changes and its rapid binding to Tie2 may be required for destabilization of endothelial cells in order to initiate the process of vascular restructuring.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Transcriptional, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: post-translation, Event Type: Protein_processing;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: plays a major role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: via, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: via, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: arteriogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: maintenance, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: down-regulated, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: down-regulation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: cleaved, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: transcriptional, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: down-regulation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: transcriptional, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: suppression, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: down-regulation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: destabilization, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: initiate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: restructuring, Event Type: Remodeling</s>"}

Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) activates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in hypoxic/ischemic tissue. In this study we demonstrate that exposure of primary cultures of cardiac and vascular cells to hypoxia or AdCA5, an adenovirus encoding a constitutively active form of HIF-1alpha, modulates the expression of genes encoding the angiogenic factors angiopoietin-1 (ANGPT1), ANGPT2, placental growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor-B. Loss-of-function effects were also observed in HIF-1alpha-null embryonic stem cells. Depending on the cell type, expression of ANGPT1 and ANGPT2 was either activated or repressed in response to hypoxia or AdCA5. In all cases, there was complete concordance between the effects of hypoxia and AdCA5. Injection of AdCA5 into mouse eyes induced neovascularization in multiple capillary beds, including those not responsive to VEGF alone. Analysis of gene expression revealed increased expression of ANGPT1, ANGPT2, platelet-derived growth factor-B, placental growth factor, and VEGF mRNA in AdCA5-injected eyes. These results indicate that HIF-1 functions as a master regulator of angiogenesis by controlling the expression of multiple angiogenic growth factors and that adenovirus-mediated expression of a constitutively active form of HIF-1alpha is sufficient to induce angiogenesis in nonischemic tissue of an adult animal.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: regulating, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: activates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: repressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: repressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: Injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: injected, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: regulator, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: controlling, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

We therefore hypothesized that ANG II could be a mediator between homeostatic changes within the vascular perfusion bed and growth factor-driven angiogenesis. In the present study, we applied the alginate implant angiogenesis model in mice with normal ANG II levels, elevated ANG II levels by transgenic overexpression of angiotensinogen (AOGEN), or in AT2 receptor-deficient mice. We demonstrate that a decrease in the amount of circulating ANG II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor enalapril or the AT1 receptor antagonist losartan induced a stimulation of in vivo angiogenesis implying an inhibitory function of ANG II through the AT1 receptor. However, the strong increase of angiogenesis in AOGEN-transgenic mice compared with mice with normal ANG II levels suggests additional stimulatory activity. We showed that the ANG II-induced stimulation of angiogenesis is linked to the AT2 receptor as an impaired induction of angiogenesis was obtained in AT2 receptor knockout mice. These findings provide the first evidence that the AT2 receptor mediates a stimulation of in vivo angiogenesis and indicate that ANG II is a humoral regulator of peripheral angiogenesis involving two receptor subtypes with opposing actions.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: exerts mitogenic effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: mediator, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: mediator, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: implant, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: elevated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: deficient, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: decrease, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: impaired, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: knockout, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: mediates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

The marked induction of angiogenesis in glioblastomas suggests that it is a necessary part of malignant progression; however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of brain tumour growth and angiogenesis remain unresolved. Here we report that a candidate tumour suppressor gene, ING4, is involved in regulating brain tumour growth and angiogenesis. Expression of ING4 is significantly reduced in gliomas as compared with normal human brain tissue, and the extent of reduction correlates with the progression from lower to higher grades of tumours. In mice, xenografts of human glioblastoma U87MG, which has decreased expression of ING4, grow significantly faster and have higher vascular volume fractions than control tumours. We show that ING4 physically interacts with p65 (RelA) subunit of nuclear factor NF-kappaB, and that ING4 regulates brain tumour angiogenesis through transcriptional repression of NF-kappaB-responsive genes. These results indicate that ING4 has an important role in brain tumour pathogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: suppressor, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: regulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: malignant progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: regulating, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulating, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: grow, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: interacts, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: regulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: has an important role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: pathogenesis, Event Type: Development</s>"}

Subsequently this activity was separated into TGFbeta and TGFalpha an EGF receptor ligand. With the discovery that TGFbeta1 was a potent growth inhibitor of epithelial cells, and the identification of inactivating mutations within the TGFbeta1 signaling pathway in cancers it became clear that TGFbeta1 signaling is a tumor suppressor pathway for early stages of cancer. However many human carcinomas overexpress TGFbeta1 and this is associated with poor patient prognosis and increased frequency of metastasis. Similar results have been obtained with tumor cell lines and experimental animal models. Thus stage specific duality of function is the emerging paradigm for the role of TGFbeta1 in cancer. This review will focus on the evidence for TGFbeta1 as a tumor promoting and metastasis factor and examine the biological and molecular basis for these effects. It is proposed that the switch from tumor suppressor to oncogene reflects genetic or epigenetic alterations in signaling pathways in tumor cells that alter the readout from the TGFbeta1 pathway.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: inactivating, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: overexpress, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: promoting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: alter, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: pathway, Event Type: Pathway</s>"}

Our laboratory has provided evidence that thrombin activates angiogenesis, a process which is essential in tumor growth and metastasis. This event is independent of fibrin formation. At the cellular level many actions of thrombin can contribute to activation of angiogenesis: (1). Thrombin decreases the ability of endothelial cells to attach to basement membrane proteins. (2). Thrombin greatly potentiates vascular endothelial growth factor- (VEGF-) induced endothelial cell proliferation. This potentiation is accompanied by up-regulation of the expression of VEGF receptors (kinase insert domain-containing receptor [KDR] and fms-like tyrosine kinase [Flt-1]). (3).

We quantified CYR61, CTGF, WISP-1, and NOV mRNA expression levels in samples from sixty-six primary gliomas and five normal brain samples using quantitative real-time PCR assay. Statistical analysis was performed to explore the links between expression of the CCN genes and clinical and pathological parameters. Overexpression of CYR61, CTGF, WISP-1, and NOV occurred in 48% (32 of 66), 58% (38 of 66), 36% (24 of 66), and 15% (10 of 66) of primary gliomas, respectively. Interestingly, significant associations were found between CYR61 expression versus tumor grade, pathology, gender, and age at diagnosis. Also, a significant correlation existed between CTGF mRNA levels versus tumor grade, gender, and pathology. In contrast to CYR61 and CTGF, no significant association was found between expression of either WISP-1 or NOV versus any of the pathological features. Furthermore, Cox regression analysis showed that CYR61 and CTGF expression had a significant correlation with patient survival. These results suggest that CYR61 and CTGF may play a role in the progression of gliomas; their levels at diagnosis may have prognostic significance; and these proteins might serve as valuable targets for therapeutic intervention.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: survival, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: survival, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: play a role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: play a role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development</s>"}

These accelerated relapses occur within 10 months of surgery for untreated patients. The mechanism proposed is a stimulation of angiogenesis for distant dormant micrometastases. This has been suggested as one of the mechanisms to explain the mammography paradox for women aged 40-49 years. We could imagine that it also plays a role in adjuvant chemotherapy effectiveness since, perhaps not coincidentally, this is most beneficial for premenopausal node-positive patients. HYPOTHESIS: We speculate that there is a burst of angiogenesis of distant dormant micrometastases after surgery in approximately 20% of premenopausal node-positive patients. We also speculate that this synchronizes them into a temporal highly chemosensitive state and is the underlying reason why adjuvant chemotherapy works particularly well for that patient category. Furthermore, this may explain why cancer in younger patients is more often 'aggressive'. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: Stimulation of dormant micrometastases by primary tumor removal is known to occur in animal models. However, we need to determine whether it happens in breast cancer. Transient circulating levels of angioactive molecules and serial high-resolution imaging studies of focal angiogenesis might help. IMPLICATIONS: Short-course cytotoxic chemotherapy after surgery has probably reached its zenith, and other strategies, perhaps antiangiogenic methods, are needed to successfully treat more patients. In addition, the hypothesis predicts that early detection, which is designed to find more patients without involved lymph nodes, may not be a synergistic strategy with adjuvant chemotherapy, which works best with positive lymph node patients.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: surgery, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: chemotherapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: surgical extirpation, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: surgery, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: untreated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: chemotherapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: burst, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: surgery, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: chemotherapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: Stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: removal, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: angioactive, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treat, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: chemotherapy, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

In brain, receptors for VEGF have been localized to vascular endothelium, neurons, and glia. VEGF is upregulated after hypoxic injury to the brain, which can occur during cerebral ischemia or high-altitude edema, and has been implicated in the blood-brain barrier breakdown associated with these conditions. Given its recently-described role as an inflammatory mediator, VEGF could also contribute to the inflammatory responses observed in cerebral ischemia. After seizures, blood-brain barrier breakdown and inflammation is also observed in brain, albeit on a lower scale than that observed after stroke. Recent evidence has suggested a role for inflammation in seizure disorders. We have described striking increases in VEGF protein in both neurons and glia after pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in the brain. Increases in VEGF could contribute to the blood-brain barrier breakdown and inflammation observed after seizures. However, VEGF has also been shown to be neuroprotective across several experimental paradigms, and hence could potentially protect vulnerable cells from damage associated with seizures. Therefore, the role of VEGF after seizures could be either protective or destructive. Although only further research will determine the exact nature of VEGF's role after seizures, preliminary data indicate that VEGF plays a protective role after seizures.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: upregulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: breakdown, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: breakdown, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: Increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: contribute, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: breakdown, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: protect, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: damage, Event Type: Breakdown</s>"}

The antiangiogenic properties of PDT have been adapted for treatment of subfoveal choroidal neovascular membranes due to disease states such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Historically, PDT has been limited by a lack of suitable photosensitive dyes. However, agents such as verteporfin, a second-generation benzoporphyrin derivative, appear to be free from the extensive phototoxicity that limited the success of previous agents. Verteporfin has a high affinity for choroidal neovascular membranes, typically found with exudative AMD, and upon photoactivation results in targeted microvascular damage and thrombus formation with resultant vessel occlusion. Scrutiny of diagnostic indicators for verteporfin administration, including critical angiographic evaluation of lesion size and visual acuity, is essential to treatment success. Large lesions with relatively good visual acuity (20/50 or better) may be at particular risk for marked vision loss following verteporfin administration. Lesion composition also appears to influence visual outcome with verteporfin use. The safety of verteporfin is directly dependent upon the appropriate integration of dosage, infusion and light activation required for a suitable pharmacotherapeutic outcome. When used appropriately, and with adequate patient education regarding photosensitivity, the risk-benefit of verteporfin for the medical treatment of neovascular AMD is favourable.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: degeneration, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: destruction, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: properties, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: degeneration, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: affinity, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: results, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: results, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: damage, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: administration, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: administration, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: use, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

METHODS: Four hundred eighty-four consecutive eyes of 446 patients treated with PDT from January 1, 2001, to June 30, 2002, were identified from billing records. Fluorescein angiograms were reviewed retrospectively to identify juxtafoveal CNV. Eligible patients had CNV in which the central boundary of the lesion was between 1 and 199 microm from the geometric center of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ). Patient charts were reviewed for visual acuity of the treated eye before PDT and at 6- and 12-month follow-up examinations. Presence of subfoveal CNV at 6 and 12 months of follow-up was determined by review of fluorescein angiograms. A lesion was considered subfoveal if it extended underneath the geometric center of the FAZ. RESULTS: Twenty-one eyes had juxtafoveal CNV. Median change in visual acuity both 6 and 12 months after the initial PDT was 0 lines (n = 18 at 6 months, range -14 to + 8 lines; n = 17 at 12 months, range -18 to + 7 lines). Eleven lesions progressed to a subfoveal location by 12 months. Visual acuity in eyes with progressive lesions decreased a median of 4 lines of vision. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a small sample size and limited length of follow-up, this study shows that visual acuity on average can remain stable for at least 12 months after PDT of juxtafoveal lesions. Growth through the foveal center still can occur, however, and this can be associated with substantial visual loss.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: progressed, Event Type: Development</s>"}

IGF-1 enhances cell proliferation and survival. We hypothesized that IGF-1-transfected smooth muscle cells (SMCs) would enhance cell survival and improve engraftment after cell transplantation. The IGF-1 gene was transfected into male SMCs and compared with SMCs transfected with a plasmid vector (vector control) and nontransfected SMCs (cell control). IGF-1 mRNA (n=10/group) and protein levels (n=6/group) were higher (P  less than 0.05 for all groups) at 3, 7, and 14 days compared with controls. VEGF was also increased in parallel to enhanced IGF-1 expression. IGF-1-transfected cells demonstrated greater cell proliferation, stimulated angiogenesis, and decreased caspase-3 activity after simulated ischemia and reperfusion (P  less than 0.05 for all groups compared with vector or cell controls). A uniform left ventricular injury was produced in female rats using a cryoprobe. Three weeks later, 2 x 10(6) cells from three groups were implanted into the scar. One week later, IGF-1-transfected SMCs had increased myocardial IGF-1 and VEGF levels, increased Bcl2 expression, limited cell apoptosis, and enhanced vessel formation in the myocardial scar compared with the two control groups (P  less than 0.05 for all groups). The proportion of SMCs surviving in the implanted region was greater (P  less than 0.05) in the IGF-1-transfected group than in the vector or cell controls.

Here, we expressed the catalytic domain of VEGFR-2 as a soluble active kinase using Bac-to-Bac expression system, and investigated correlations between VEGFR-2 activity and enzyme concentration, ATP concentration, substrate concentration and divalent cation type. We used these data to establish a convenient, effective and non-radioactive ELISA screening technique for the identification and evaluation of potential inhibitors for VEGFR-2 kinase. We screened 200 RTK target-based compounds and identified one (TKI-31) that potently inhibited VEGFR-2 kinase activity (IC50=0.596 microM). Treatment of NIH3T3/KDR cells with TKI-31 blocked VEGF-induced phosphorylation of KDR in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, TKI-31 dose-dependently suppressed HUVEC tube formation.

To prevent adhesions, an experimental study was planned to designate the effects of low molecular weight (LMW) heparins and hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy both on the formation of adhesions and wound healing. METHODS: Thirty-eight Wistar albino rats underwent laparotomy to cause intra-abdominal adhesions by mechanical abrasion of the cecum and ethanol application. The rats were divided into 4 groups. In the control group (group 1) no further management was undertaken. Group 2 was treated by Enoxaparine Na, group 3 received HBO therapy, and group 4 was given both enoxaparine Na and HBO treatment. RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference between the control and enoxaparine Na groups regarding adhesions. Statistically significant differences were observed between groups 1 and 4 and between groups 1 and 3 regarding the hydroxyproline content of the abdominal wounds. In the pathologic analysis of the abdominal wounds, there was no statistically significant difference between any of the groups, including the control group, regarding inflammation. Statistically significant differences were observed regarding angiogenesis between the control group and groups 3 and 4. There was also a statistically significant difference regarding fibrosis between groups 1 and 4.

However, whether hemostatic factors contribute directly or indirectly to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remains uncertain. Autopsy studies have revealed that intimal thickening represents the first stage of atherosclerosis and that lipid-rich plaque arises from such lesions. Several factors contribute to the start of intimal thickening. Platelets release several growth factors and bioactive agents that play a central role in development of not only thrombus but also of intimal thickening. We have been investigating which coagulation factors simultaneously, or subsequently with platelet aggregation, participate in thrombus formation. Tissue factor (TF) is an essential initiator of blood coagulation that is expressed in various stages of atherosclerotic lesions in humans and other animals. Factors including thrombin and fibrin, which are downstream of the coagulation cascade activated by TF, also contribute to atherosclerosis. TF is involved in cell migration, embryogenesis and angiogenesis. Thus TF, in addition to factors downstream of the coagulation cascade and the protease-activated receptor 2 activation system, would be a multifactorial regulator of atherogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: play a crucial role, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: generating, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: damage, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: thickening, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: contribute, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: thickening, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: play a central role, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: play a central role, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: thickening, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: aggregation, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: participate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: downstream, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: downstream, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: coagulation cascade, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: involved, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: involved, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: coagulation cascade, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: activation system, Event Type: Pathway</s>"}

Recent in vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that they may also have direct antitumor effects via induction of apoptosis, inhibition of the invasive potential of tumor cell lines in vitro, inhibition of angiogenesis, and reduction in tumor growth indirectly via effects on accessory cells. This is a randomized, open label, prospective study that examined the effect of preventive zoledronic acid treatment on the development of bone metastases in patients with recurrent solid tumors, without bone metastases at the time of randomization. METHODS: Forty patients with recurrent or metastatic advanced cancer, without bone metastases, were randomized into the trial to either receive zoledronic acid or no treatment. Patients were followed up until bone metastases were established. RESULTS: The percentage of patients being bone metastases free at 12 mo was 60% in the zoledronic acid and 10% in the control group (p less than 0.0005), while the percentages at 18 mo were 20% and 5% respectively (p=0.0002). CONCLUSIONS: The results have shown that bisphosphonates as adjuvant treatment might be useful for the prevention of bone metastases; however, there is need for blinded randomized data before such an approach would be confirmed.

METHODS: Human umbilical endothelial cells were treated with angiostatin or thalidomide and bFGF-induced proliferation was assessed with the MTT assay. Human cervical cancer cells (CaSki and SiHa) were injected into the flanks of nude mice. After tumors developed, mice were treated with angiostatin 20 mg/kg/day or thalidomide 200 mg/kg/day for 30 days. Fractional tumor growth was determined and immunohistochemical analysis of tumors was used to determine degree of angiogenesis. TUNEL assay was used to assess apoptosis. RESULTS: Angiostatin inhibited endothelial cell proliferation by 50-60%. Thalidomide had no direct effect on endothelial cells. Angiostatin and thalidomide both inhibited tumor growth by about 55%. We found no additive or synergistic effect when the two agents were combined. Both agents inhibited angiogenesis and induced apoptosis when compared to tumors from control animals. CONCLUSIONS: Angiostatin and thalidomide inhibit tumor growth, angiogenesis, and induce apoptosis in this xenograft model of cervical cancer.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: apoptosis, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: injected, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: injected, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: developed, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: no direct effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: apoptosis, Event Type: Death</s>"}

(TEMF) alone and in combination with gamma irradiation (IR) therapy in nude mice bearing a human MDA MB231 breast cancer xenograft were tested. Green fluorescence protein transfected cancer cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of young female mice. Six weeks later, mice were randomly divided into four treatment groups: untreated controls; 10 minute daily TEMF; 200 cGy of IR every other day (total 800 cGy); IR plus daily TEMF. Some mice in each group were euthanized 24 hours after the end of IR. TEMF treatment continued for 3 additional weeks. Tumor sections were stained for: endothelial cells with CD31 and PAS or hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha (HIF). RESULTS: Most tumors  less than 35 mm3 were white but tumors  greater than 35 mm3 were pink and had a vascularized capsule. The cortex within 100 microns of the capsule had little vascularization. Blood vessels, capillaries, and endothelial pseudopods were found at  greater than 100 microns from the capsule (subcortex). Tumors  greater than 35 mm3 treated with IR 24 hours previously or with TEMF had decreased blood vessels in the subcortex and more endothelial pseudopods projecting into hypoxic, HIF positive areas than tumors from the control group. Mice that received either IR or TEMF had significantly fewer lung metastatic sites and slower tumor growth than did untreated mice. No harmful side effects were attributed to TEMF. CONCLUSION: TEMF therapy provided a safe means for retarding tumor vascularization, growth and metastasis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: transfected, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: injected, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: euthanized, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: untreated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: retarding, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: retarding, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: retarding, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization</s>"}

TSP interacts with a number of proteases and receptors and in this way inhibits stimulation of angiogenesis. An earlier study showed that thrombospondin is expressed in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) but is absent in prostate cancer. The present study was therefore designed to evaluate the expression of thrombospondin 1 and 2 (TSP-1, TSP-2), TSP receptors CD36 and CD47, and matrix-metalloproteases 2 and 9 (MMP-, MMP-9) in a rat prostate cancer model. By using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and real-time PCR the expression patterns of TSP-1, TSP-2, CD36, CD47, MMP-2, and MMP-9 were investigated in normal rat prostate tissue and five malignant Dunning sublines tissue. TSP-1 mRNA levels were decreased in all tumours compared with normal prostate. However, there was no difference in expression of TSP-2 and CD36 mRNA in these samples. MMP-2 was increased with malignancy, but no expression of MMP-9 was seen. The CD47 receptor did slightly increase with malignancy except for H3327. The results showed that thrombospondin is expressed in normal prostate but not in prostate tumours in a rat model. Simultaneously, MMP-2 expression increases with malignancy.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: controlling, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: interacts, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: absent, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation</s>"}

Recent evidence suggests the existence of endothelial precursors in adult bone marrow cells, but it is unclear whether those precursors have a role in tumor neovascularization. In this report, we demonstrate that murine bone marrow contains endothelial progenitors, which arise from a cell with self-renewing capacity, and can integrate into tumor microvasculature, albeit at a very low frequency. A transgenic double-reporter strategy allowed us to demonstrate definitively that tumor bone marrow-derived endothelial cells arise by transdifferentiation of marrow progenitors rather than by cell fusion. Single cell transplants showed that a common precursor contributes to both the hemopoietic and endothelial lineages, thus demonstrating the presence of an adult hemangioblast. Furthermore, we demonstrate that increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A secretion by tumor cells, as well as activation of VEGF receptor-2 in bone marrow cells does not alter the mobilization and incorporation of marrow-derived endothelial progenitors into tumor vasculature. Finally, in human umbilical cord blood cells, we show that endothelial precursors make up only approximately 1 in 10(7) mononuclear cells but are highly enriched in the CD133+ cell population. By ruling out cell fusion, we clearly demonstrate the existence of an adult hemangioblast, but the differentiation of marrow stem cells toward the endothelial lineage is an extremely rare event. Furthermore, we show that VEGF-A stimulation of hemopoietic cells does not significantly alter this process.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: contribution, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: originate, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: originate, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: existence, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: have a role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: transdifferentiation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: fusion, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: transplants, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: contributes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: contributes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: incorporation, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: fusion, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: existence, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: differentiation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation</s>"}

HYPOTHESIS: This study was designed to compare coronary collateral circulation (CCC) in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) with that in patients without DR. METHODS: Ninety diabetic patients with chronic total occlusion in at least one major epicardial coronary artery were enrolled in the study. Groups 1 and 2 consisted of 48 patients without DR and 42 patients with PDR, respectively. Coronary collateral circulation (CCC) was analyzed according to the Rentrop system. Each group was also divided into two subgroups according to poor and good CCC. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. RESULTS: The mean Rentrop collateral score was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (2.39 +/- 1.07 vs. 1.76 +/- 0.76, respectively, p  less than  0.001). When the two groups were compared with respect to poor and good CCC, poor CCC was higher in patients with PDR (64 vs. 36%, respectively, p = 0.01). Serum VEGF levels were higher in patients with PDR than in those without DR (219 +/- 99 vs. 139 +/- 98 pg/ml, p  less than  0.001); however, patients with poor and good CCC had similar VEGF levels. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that patients with PDR have a lower coronary collateral score than patients without DR. Also, serum VEGF was significantly higher in patients with PDR than in those without DR. These findings have suggested that diabetes mellitus may have a different action on retinal and coronary circulation.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

This study examines the mechanism of HKa and D5 inhibition of two potent stimulators of endothelial cell migration, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), that act through the P13-kinase-Akt signaling pathway. HKa and D5 inhibit bovine pulmonary artery endothelial cell (BPAE) or human umbilical vein endothelial cell chemotaxis in the modified-Boyden chamber in response toVEGF or S1P. The inhibition of migration by HKa is reversed by antibodies to urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Both HKa and D5 decrease the speed of BPAE cell migration and alter the morphology in live, time-lapse microscopy after stimulation with S1P or VEGF. HKa and D5 reduce the localization of paxillin to the focal adhesions after S1P and VEGF stimulation. To better understand the intracellular signaling pathways, we examined the effect of HKa on the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream effector, GSK-3alpha HKa and D5 inhibit phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3alpha after stimulation withVEGF and S1P. Inhibitors of Akt and P13-kinase, the upstream activator of Akt, block endothelial cell migration and disrupt paxillin localization to the focal adhesions after stimulation with VEGF and S1P. Therefore we suggest that HKa through its D5 domain alters P13-kinase-Akt signaling to inhibit endothelial cell migration through alterations in the focal adhesions.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: cleaved, Event Type: Protein_processing;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: cleaved, Event Type: Protein_processing;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: signaling pathways, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: involved, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: act, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: signaling pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: chemotaxis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: chemotaxis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: response, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: response, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: response, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: response, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: reversed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reversed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decrease, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reduce, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: localization, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: block, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: disrupt, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: localization, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: alters, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: alterations, Event Type: Regulation</s>"}

Excessive vascular development and blood vessel remodeling appears in psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic retinopathy and solid tumors formation. Thalidomide [alpha-(N-phthalimido)-glutarimide] is known to be a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, but the mechanism of its inhibitory action remains unclear. The aim of the study was to investigate the potential influence of thalidomide on the several steps of angiogenesis, using in vitro models. We have evaluated the effect of thalidomide on VEGF secretion, cell migration, adhesion as well as in capillary formation of human endothelial cell line EA.hy 926. Thalidomide at the concentrations of 0.01 microM and 10 microM inhibited VEGF secretion into supernatants, decreased the number of formed capillary tubes and increased cell adhesion to collagen. Administration of thalidomide at the concentration of 0.01 microM increased cell migration, while at 10 microM, it decreased cell migration. Thalidomide in concentrations from 0.1 microM to 10 microM did not change cell proliferation of 72-h cell cultures. We conclude that anti-angiogenic action of thalidomide is due to direct inhibitory action on VEGF secretion and capillary microvessel formation as well as immunomodulatory influence on EA.hy 926 cells migration and adhesion.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: cell migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: Angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: regulated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: stimulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migrate, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: proliferate, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: differentiate, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: form, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibitory action, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: influence, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: cell migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: formed, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: Administration, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: change, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: action, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: due, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: due, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibitory action, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibitory action, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: influence, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: influence, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding</s>"}

This study aims to verify the relationship between p63 expression and several clinicopathological features and tumor markers of clinical significance in breast pathology including key regulators of the cell cycle, oncogenes, apoptosis-related proteins, metalloproteinases and their inhibitors. Immunohistochemistry with 27 primary antibodies was performed in 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples of invasive ductal carcinomas. p63-positive cells were found in 16% of carcinomas. p63-positive carcinomas were poorly differentiated, hormone receptor-negative neoplasms with a high proliferation rate. p63 also correlated with advanced pathological stage, tumor size, and the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT), tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The expression of TIMP1 suggests that the anti-proteolytic stimuli may be preponderant in p63-positive carcinomas. hTERT activity is associated with nodal metastases and cellular proliferation. VEGF regulates angiogenesis, which is also a fundamental event in the process of tumor growth and metastatic dissemination. Thus, the differential regulation of hTERT and VEGF in p63-positive breast carcinomas may contribute to the clinically more aggressive behavior of these neoplasms.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: differentiated, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: regulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastatic dissemination, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation</s>"}

LRP-1 also is implicated in integrin maturation. In this study, we applied a proteomics strategy to identify novel proteins involved in ECM modeling that are regulated by LRP-1. We show that LRP-1 deficiency in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) is associated with increased levels of type III collagen and pigment epithelium-derived factor, which accumulate in the substratum surrounding cells. The collagen receptor, uPAR-AP/Endo-180, is also increased in LRP-1-deficient MEFs. Human LRP-1 reversed the changes in protein expression associated with LRP-1 deficiency; however, the endocytic activity of LRP-1 was not involved. Instead, regulation occurred at the mRNA level. Inhibition of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) blocked type III collagen expression in LRP-1-deficient MEFs, suggesting regulation of JNK activity as a mechanism by which LRP-1 controls mRNA expression. The ability of LRP-1 to regulate expression of the factors identified here suggests a role for LRP-1 in determining blood vessel structure and in angiogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: bind, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: implicated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: maturation, Event Type: Protein_processing;\nTrigger: modeling, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: regulated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: deficiency, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: deficient, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: deficiency, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: deficient, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

Here, we show that NCAM-deficient beta cell tumors grew leaky blood vessels with perturbed pericyte-endothelial cell-cell interactions and deficient perivascular deposition of ECM components. Conversely, tumor cell expression of NCAM in a fibrosarcoma model (T241) improved pericyte recruitment and increased perivascular deposition of ECM molecules. Together, these findings suggest that NCAM may limit tumor cell metastasis by stabilizing the microvessel wall.

A role for NF-kappaB in cancer cells appears to involve regulation of cell proliferation, control of apoptosis, promotion of angiogenesis, and stimulation of invasion/metastasis. Consistent with a role for NF-kappaB in oncogenesis are observations that inhibition of NF-kappaB alone or in combination with cancer therapies leads to tumor cell death or growth inhibition. However, other experimental data indicate that NF-kappaB can play a tumor suppressor role in certain settings and that it can be important in promoting an apoptotic signal downstream of certain cancer therapy regimens. In order to appropriately move NF-kappaB inhibitors in the clinic, thorough approaches must be initiated to determine the molecular mechanisms that dictate the complexity of oncologic and therapeutic outcomes that are controlled by NF-kappaB.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: cell proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: control, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: apoptosis, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: promotion, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: therapies, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: leads, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: leads, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: death, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: play, Event Type: Negative_regulation</s>"}

Cancer neoangiogenesis is often disordered and abnormal, with evidence of coexisting vascular endothelial dysfunction. A novel method of assessing vascular endothelial function in cancer is via the quantification of circulating endothelial cells (CEC). Unusual in healthy individuals, their presence in elevated numbers often indicates substantial vascular endothelial perturbation. Another interesting cell type is the endothelial progenitor cell (EPC), whose numbers increase in the presence of vascular damage. Recent research suggests that EPCs have an important role in tumor vasculogenesis. Another marker being investigated in the context of vascular dysfunction and coagulopathy is the endothelial microparticle (EMP). Thus, CECs, EPCs and EMPs may represent potentially novel methods for evaluating the vascular status of cancer patients. This review will summarize the current position of CECs, EPCs and EMPs in cell biology terms, with particular emphasis on their relationship to malignant disease.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: neoangiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: neoangiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: dysfunction, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: damage, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: have an important role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: vasculogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: dysfunction, Event Type: Breakdown</s>"}

Structural changes were promoted by toxicity of glucose degradation products (GDPs) which are generated during heat sterilization in peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDFs). Besides their direct toxicity GDPs promote formation of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs). RAGE (receptor for AGE) is the best characterized signal transduction receptor for AGEs and is expressed on mesothelial cells. The effects of PDFs with different amounts of GDPs were compared on morphological changes in the peritoneal membrane in a RAGE -/- mouse model. It could be demonstrated that RAGE plays a pivotal role in structural damage (e.g. inflammation, neoangiogenesis and fibrosis) of the peritoneal membrane. Further investigations of this pathway with regard to preventing peritoneal fibrosis should be performed to maintain the integrity of the peritoneal membrane in peritoneal dialysis patients.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: damage, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: morphological changes, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: promoted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Synthesis;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: morphological changes, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: plays a pivotal role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: plays a pivotal role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: structural damage, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: neoangiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

Here we show that angiogenesis is severely impaired in PSMA-null animals and that this angiogenic defect occurs at the level of endothelial cell invasion through the extracellular matrix barrier. Because proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix is a critical component of endothelial invasion in angiogenesis, it is logical to assume that PSMA participates in matrix degradation. However, we demonstrate a novel and more complex role for PSMA in angiogenesis, where it is a principal component of a regulatory loop that is tightly modulating laminin-specific integrin signaling and GTPase-dependent, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK-1) activity. We show that PSMA inhibition, knockdown, or deficiency decreases endothelial cell invasion in vitro via integrin and PAK, thus abrogating angiogenesis. Interestingly, the neutralization of beta(1) or the inactivation of PAK increases PSMA activity, suggesting that they negatively regulate PSMA. This negative regulation is mediated by the cytoskeleton as the disruption of interactions between the PSMA cytoplasmic tail and the anchor protein filamin A decreases PSMA activity, integrin function, and PAK activation. Finally, the inhibition of PAK activation enhances the PSMA/filamin A interaction and, thus, boosts PSMA activity. These data imply that PSMA participates in an autoregulatory loop, wherein active PSMA facilitates integrin signaling and PAK activation, leading to both productive invasion and downregulation of integrin beta(1) signaling via reduced PSMA activity. Therefore, we have identified a novel role for PSMA as a true molecular interface, integrating both extracellular and intracellular signals during angiogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: regulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: modulating, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: upregulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: impaired, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: defect, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: participates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: modulating, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulating, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: knockdown, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: deficiency, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: abrogating, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: neutralization, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inactivation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: negatively regulate, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: negatively regulate, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: negative regulation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: disruption, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: interactions, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreases, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhances, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhances, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: boosts, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: participates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: facilitates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: facilitates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: leading, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: downregulation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Porous PLGA microspheres having primary amine groups on the surface were prepared using an oil-in-water (O/W) single emulsion method using Pluronic F-127 as an extractable porogen. Heparin was surface immobilized via covalent conjugation. bFGF was loaded into the heparin functionalized (PLGA-heparin) microspheres by a simple dipping method. The bFGF loaded PLGA-heparin microspheres were tested for in vitro release and in vivo angiogenic activity. RESULTS: PLGA microspheres with an open-porous structure were formed. The amount of conjugated amine group onto the microspheres was 1.93+/-0.01 nmol/mg-microspheres, while the amount of heparin was 95.8 pmol/mg-microspheres. PLGA-heparin microspheres released out bFGF in a more sustained manner with a smaller extent of initial burst than PLGA microspheres, indicating that surface immobilized heparin controlled the release rate of bFGF. Subcutaneous implantation of bFGF loaded PLGA-heparin microspheres in mice significantly induced the formation of new vascular microvessels. CONCLUSIONS: PLGA microspheres with an open porous structure allowed significant amount of heparin immobilization and bFGF loading. bFGF loaded PLGA-HP microspheres showed sustained release profiles of bFGF in vitro, demonstrating reversible and specific binding of bFGF to immobilized heparin.

Until recently, their role in pathogenesis was largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss the reported involvement of syndecans in human cancers, infectious diseases, obesity, wound healing and angiogenesis. In some cancers, syndecan expression has been shown to regulate tumor cell function (e.g. proliferation, adhesion, and motility) and serve as a prognostic marker for tumor progression and patient survival. The ectodomains and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecans can also act as receptors/co-receptors for some bacterial and viral pathogens, mediating infection. In addition, syndecans bind to obesity-related factors and regulate their signaling, in turn modulating food consumption and weight balance. In vivo animal models of tissue injury and in vitro data also implicate syndecans in processes necessary for wound healing, including fibroblast and endothelial proliferation, cell motility, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix organization. These new insights into the involvement of syndecans in disease and tissue repair coupled with the emergence of syndecan-specific molecular tools may lead to novel therapies for a variety of human diseases.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: regulate, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulate, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulate, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: motility, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: survival, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: bind, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: injury, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: necessary, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: necessary, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: necessary, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: necessary, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: necessary, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: motility, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: organization, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: repair, Event Type: Remodeling</s>"}

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We assessed response, toxicity, and biomarkers of angiogenesis to low-dose cyclophosphamide (50 mg p.o. o.d.) and high-dose celecoxib (400 mg p.o. b.i.d.) in adult patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in a multicenter phase II prospective study. RESULTS: Thirty-two of 35 patients (median age, 62 years) are evaluable for response. Patients had primarily relapsed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (63%) were heavily pretreated (median of three regimens) and high risk (79% international prognostic index,  greater than or=2) and 34% were relapsed after autologous stem cell transplant. With a median follow-up of 8.4 months, the overall best response rate is 37% (2 complete clinical response/complete clinical response unconfirmed and 9 partial response), with 22% achieving stable disease. Median overall and progression-free survivals are 14.4 and 4.7 months, respectively. The median response duration was 8.2 months. The most common toxicity was skin rash (40%); myelosuppression and gastrointestinal side effects were uncommon. Three patients developed deep vein thromboses and two heavily pretreated patients developed treatment-related acute myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplasia after 3.7 and 12 months of therapy. Circulating endothelial cells and their precursors declined and remained low in responders, whereas plasma vascular endothelial growth factor trended to decline in responding patients but increase in nonresponders.

Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a potent vasoconstrictor that increases concomitant with sFlt-1 during pregnancy. Therefore, we speculated that Ang II may promote the expression of sFlt-1 in pregnancy. Here we report that infusion of Ang II significantly increases circulating levels of sFlt-1 in pregnant mice, thereby demonstrating that Ang II is a regulator of sFlt-1 secretion in vivo. Furthermore, Ang II stimulated sFlt-1 production in a dose- and time-dependent manner from human villous explants and cultured trophoblasts but not from endothelial cells, suggesting that trophoblasts are the primary source of sFlt-1 during pregnancy. As expected, Ang II-induced sFlt-1 secretion resulted in the inhibition of endothelial cell migration and in vitro tube formation. In vitro and in vivo studies with losartan, small interfering RNA specific for calcineurin and FK506 demonstrated that Ang II-mediated sFlt-1 release was via Ang II type 1 receptor activation and calcineurin signaling, respectively. These findings reveal a previously unrecognized regulatory role for Ang II on sFlt-1 expression in murine and human pregnancy and suggest that elevated sFlt-1 levels in preeclampsia may be caused by a dysregulation of the local renin/angiotensin system.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: calcineurin signaling pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: dysfunction, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: circulating, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: circulating, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: infusion, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: circulating, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: calcineurin signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: regulatory role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulatory role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: elevated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: caused, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: dysregulation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: system, Event Type: Pathway</s>"}

Here we show that recombinant human prothrombin kringle-2 (rk-2) inhibited bovine capillary endothelial cell migration with an IC(50) (concentration for half maximal inhibition) of 38 nM and inhibited adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Because tumor metastasis requires angiogenesis, we examined whether rk-2 could inhibit metastases induced by injection of B16F10 melanoma cells into mice. The results revealed that the metastatic tumors in mouse lung were markedly decreased in a dose-dependent manner and acute lung injury induced by B16F10 melanoma metastasis was diminished by systemic rk-2 treatment. In immunohistochemical analysis, rk-2 reduced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, which is a potent angiogenic activator and neovascularization in the mouse lung. Also, rk-2 diminished the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and -9 in the mouse lung which induces tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. These data suggest that inhibition of B16F10 melanoma metastasis by rk-2 was caused by inhibition of neovascularization and reduction of matrix metalloproteinase expression.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: essential, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: requires, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: metastatic, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: diminished, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: diminished, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: caused, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: caused, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression</s>"}

Common features of this ECM-assisted tissue remodelling include angiogenesis, recruitment of circulating progenitor cells and constructive remodelling of damaged tissue structures.

To test the hypothesis that 20-HETE increases endothelial cell (EC) proliferation via vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), we studied the effects of WIT003 [20-hydroxyeicosa-5(Z),14(Z)-dienoic acid], a 20-HETE analog on human macrovascular or microvascular EC. WIT003, as well as pure 20-HETE, stimulated EC proliferation by approximately 40%. These proliferative effects were accompanied by increased VEGF expression and release that were observed as early as 4 h after 20-HETE agonist addition. This was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of the VEGF receptor 2. The proliferative effects of 20-HETE were markedly inhibited by a VEGF-neutralizing antibody. Polyethylene glycol-superoxide dismutase (PEG-SOD) markedly inhibited both the increases in VEGF expression and the proliferative effects of 20-HETE. In contrast, administration of the NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor apocynin had no effect to the proliferative response to 20-HETE. The 20-HETE agonist markedly increased superoxide formation as reflected by an increase in dihydroethidium staining of EC, and this increase was inhibited by PEG-SOD but not by apocynin.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: formed, Event Type: Synthesis;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: administration, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Synthesis;\nTrigger: staining, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation</s>"}

METHOD: The intratumor microvessel density (IMVD), apoptotic index (AI) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression were detected by immunohistochemistry SABC and terminal uridine deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling(TUNEL) methods in34 LSCC patients. RESULT: The average IMVD was (21.50 +/- 8.87), and median of AI was 1.15%. The average IMVD in positive and negative cervical lymphatic metastasis was (26.33 +/- 9.70) and (17.68 +/- 6.06) respectively, and the IMVD with positive lymphatic metastasis tumors was statistical significantly higher than those with negative cervical lymphatic metastasis tumors (P  less than  0.01). The average IMVD had statistical difference in histological grading (P  less than  0.01), and analysis by one to one, the average IMVD had statistical difference between high and median grading. Expression of VEGF had a significantly positive correlation with IMVD (r = 0.51, P  less than  0.01). Statistical analysis revealed a significantly inverse correlation between AI and IMVD (r = -0.53, P  less than  0.01). We failed to find the statistical difference between IMVD and tumor T-stage in LSCC. CONCLUSION: IMVD may be an important indicator to predict cervical lymphatic metastasis in LSCC. VEGF might be an important angiogenic factor, and could promote tumor angiogenesis in LSCC.

We tested whether as well as inhibiting leukocyte elastase (LE) activity, Hyp might be effective in containing both polymorphonuclear neutrophil (PMN) leukocyte recruitment and unfavorable eventual tissue responses. The results show that, without affecting in vitro human PMN viability and chemokine-receptor expression, Hyp (as stable dicyclohexylammonium salt) was able to inhibit in a dose-dependent manner their chemotaxis and chemoinvasion (IC50=1 microM for both); this effect was associated with a reduced expression of the adhesion molecule CD11b by formyl-Met-Leu-Phe-stimulated neutrophils and block of LE-triggered activation of the gelatinase matrix metalloproteinase-9. PMN-triggered angiogenesis is also blocked by both local injection and daily i.p. administration of the Hyp salt in an interleukin-8-induced murine model. Furthermore, i.p. treatment with Hyp reduces acute PMN recruitment and enhances resolution in a pulmonary bleomycin-induced inflammation model, significantly reducing consequent fibrosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two MRI exams were performed with intravascular contrast media in 21 rats: tumours were induced by subcutaneous injection of colon carcinoma cells in 7 rats and mammary adenocarcinoma cells in 14 rats. Perfusion and permeability parameters of the implanted tumours were evaluated by using two contrast media (B22956/1 and Gd-DTPA37-albumin) to establish response to treatment with two different antiangiogenic drugs (tamoxifen and SU6668). These parameters were correlated with histology to obtain a radiological-histological map of tumour microvasculature. RESULTS: DCE-MRI revealed greater enhancement in the peripheral area than in the central area in all the examined animal models. In the mammary carcinoma experiment, vascular permeability measured by means of B22956/1 in the animals treated with the antiangiogenic drug (0.0043317+/-0.0040418 ml/min(-1)/ml(-1)) was significantly less than in untreated animals (0.0090460+/-0.0043680 ml/min(-1)/ml(-1)), whereas no significant difference was observed with Gd-DTPA-albumin (13.14+/-13.94 ml/min(-1)/ml(-1) in treated animals and 18.07+/-11.92 ml/min(-1)/ml(-1) in untreated animals).[/INST]\n\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: subcutaneous injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: subcutaneous injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: implanted, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

Here we produced a neutralizing antibody, 1B3, directed against mouse PDGFRbeta. 1B3 binds to PDGFRbeta with high affinity (9x10(-11)M) and blocks PDGF-BB from binding to the receptor with an IC(50) of approximately 1.2 nM. The antibody also blocks ligand-stimulated activation of PDGFRbeta and downstream signaling molecules, including Akt and MAPK p42/44, in tumor cells. In animal studies, 1B3 significantly enhanced the antitumor and the anti-angiogenic activities of DC101, an antibody directed against mouse vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, in a pancreatic (BxPC-3) and a non-small cell lung (NCI-H460) tumor xenograft models. Treatment with the combination of 1B3 and DC101 in BxPC-3 xenograft-bearing mice resulted in tumor regression in 58% of mice compared to that in 18% of mice treated with DC101 alone. Taken together, these results lend great support to use PDGFRbeta antagonists in combinations with other antitumor and/or anti-angiogenic agents in the treatment of a variety of cancers.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: enhances, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhances, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhances, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activities, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activities, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: promoting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: enhancing, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhancing, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhancing, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhancing, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: recruitment, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: maturation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: binds, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: blocks, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: blocks, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: blocks, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: blocks, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activities, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activities, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: Treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: regression, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

The internal convex surface of the caruncles of non-pregnant does was covered with capillary meshes of regular diameter and form, without crypts. As pregnancy advanced the complexity of the vasculature increased: at 4 weeks the surface showed a pattern of ridges separated by troughs. At later stages, branches of radial arteries penetrated the periphery forming an extensive mesh of capillaries on the concave surface. Capillary diameters increased significantly during pregnancy, especially after 4 weeks, when large flattened sinusoids formed. These sinusoids had a great deal of surface area for potential contact with the fetal component. The caprine placenta is usually considered to have increased interhemal distance compared with endotheliochorial and hemochorial types: our results suggest that the very extensive development of sinusoids and crypts may compensate for any negative consequences of the placental architecture. Placental angiogenesis, which is physiologically normal, may serve as a general model of this process in other circumstances, such as tumor. The effect of swainsonine (active compound of locoweed and a potential anticancer drug) on vascular development showed no differences in sinusoidal diameters at 7 weeks, but a decrease in capillary density was noted. Swainsonine caused a great distortion to the vasculature at 18 weeks.

Endothelial cell proliferation plays a pivotal role in the process of angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to compare angiogenesis parameters in low nuclear grade (n=87) vs high nuclear grade CC-RCC (n=63). A panel of antibodies was used for immunohistochemistry: CD34/Ki-67, carbonic anhydrase IX, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Vessel density (MVD - microvessel density), endothelial cell proliferation fraction (ECP%) and tumour cell proliferation fraction (TCP%) were assessed. mRNA expression levels of angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. High-grade CC-RCC showed a higher ECP% (P=0.049), a higher TCP% (P=0.009), a higher VEGF protein expression (P less than 0.001), a lower MVD (P less than  0.001) and a lower HIF-1alpha protein expression (P=0.002) than low-grade CC-RCC. Growth factor mRNA expression analyses revealed a higher expression of angiopoietin 2 in low-grade CC-RCC. Microvessel density and ECP% were inversely correlated (Rho=-0.26, P=0.001).

Dvorak to the study of tumor angiogenesis and stroma generation mechanisms.\n\nIn 1983, Harold Dvorak and his colleagues were the first to show that tumor cells secreted vascular permeability factor (VPF) and that a blocking antibody to VPF could prevent the edema and fluid accumulation that is characteristic of human cancers. In 1986, Dvorak went on to demonstrate that VPF was secreted by a variety of human tumor cell lines and proposed that VPF was in part responsible for the abnormal vasculature seen in human tumors. As a result, he and other investigators demonstrated that VPF was capable of stimulating endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. These fundamental discoveries led to additional research conducted by Napoleone Ferrara and his laboratory, confirming the cloning of VPF and renaming the protein vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In 1986, Dvorak proposed that by secreting VPF, tumors induce angiogenesis by turning on the wound healing response. He noted that wounds, like tumors, secrete VPF, causing blood vessels to leak plasma fibrinogen, which stimulates blood vessel growth and provides a matrix on which they can spread. Unlike wounds, however, that turn off VPF production after healing, tumors did not turn off their VPF production and instead continued to make large amounts of VPF, allowing malignant cells to continue to induce new blood vessels and so to grow and spread. Thus, tumors behave like wounds that fail to heal. This work is again extremely significant for patients worldwide, as Dvorak's scientific research is leading his colleagues all over the world to examine how to treat a tumor through its blood supply.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: generation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: secreted, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: prevent, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: secreted, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: secreting, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: secrete, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: leak, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: turn off, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: turn off, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: make, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: grow, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: spread, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: treat, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

A validated assay in human fat tissue is needed to study the role of angiogenesis in human obesity. METHODS: Human fat tissue fragments from surgery were placed in 96-well plates, embedded in fibrin thrombin clot and overlaid with cell culture media containing 20% fetal bovine serum. After 15 days, the clots were examined by histology and electron microscopy. The effect of taxol, cobalt chloride and a heparin-steroid combination was tested in the fat tissue assay and compared to the validated human placental vein angiogenesis model (HPVAM). RESULTS: Blood vessels initiated growth and elongated from the fat tissue fragments over 15 days. Presence of blood vessels was confirmed with histology and electron microscopy. Taxol at 10(-6) and 10(-7) M completely inhibited angiogenesis, while Taxol 10(-8) and 10(-9) M and the heparin-steroid partially inhibited angiogenesis. The response to taxol and heparin-steroid was similar to that of the HPVAM, a validated angiogenesis assay. Cobalt chloride, a stimulator of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) stimulated angiogenesis initiation at 10(-9) M in fat tissue and the HPVAM, but at 10(-10) M blood vessel growth was stimulated only in the fat assay. CONCLUSION: This angiogenesis assay based on human fat tissue uses three-dimensionally intact human tissue. The vessels are derived from quiescient vessels within the fat. These properties allow the angiogenic switch to be evaluated in an in vitro setting. The angiogenic response of fat tissue is not identical to placental tissue. This assay allows exploration of angiogenesis in fat tissue.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: surgery, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: placed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: embedded, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: overlaid, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: culture, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: initiated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: elongated, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: exploration, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

This pathway has been implicated to play a role in the pathogenesis of cancer and in embryonic blood vessel development. In the current study, Hedgehog signaling in tumor related vasculature and microenvironment was examined using human umbilical vein endothelial cells and B16F0 (murine melanoma) tumors models. Use of exogenous Sonic hedgehog (Shh) peptide significantly increased BrdU incorporation in endothelial cells in vitro by a factor of 2 (P  less than  0.001). The Hedgehog pathway antagonist cyclopamine effectively reduced Shh-induced proliferation to control levels. To study Hedgehog signaling in vivo a hind limb tumor model with the B16F0 cell line was used. Treatment with 25 mg/kg cyclopamine significantly attenuated BrdU incorporation in tumor cells threefold (P  less than  0.001), in tumor related endothelial cells threefold (P = 0.004), and delayed tumor growth by 4 days. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the Hedgehog receptor Patched was localized to the tumor stroma and that B16F0 cells expressed Shh peptide. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts required the presence of B16F0 cells to express Patched in a co-culture assay system. These studies indicate that Shh peptide produced by melanoma cells induces Patched expression in fibroblasts. To study tumor related angiogenesis a vascular window model was used to monitor tumor vascularity. Treatment with cyclopamine significantly attenuated vascular formation by a factor of 2.5 (P  less than  0.001) and altered vascular morphology. Furthermore, cyclopamine reduced tumor blood vessel permeability to FITC labeled dextran while having no effect on normal blood vessels. These studies suggest that Hedgehog signaling regulates melanoma related vascular formation and function.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: intercellular signaling pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: differentiation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: incorporation, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: Treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: attenuated, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: incorporation, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: delayed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: localized, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: express, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: produced, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: attenuated, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: altered, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: labeled, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: regulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development</s>"}

Here we demonstrated that all retinal MCs express CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1) and that homozygosity for the CX3CR1 M280 allele, which is associated with impaired cell migration, increases the risk of AMD. In humans with AMD, MCs accumulated in the subretinal space at sites of retinal degeneration and choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In CX3CR1-deficient mice, MCs accumulated subretinally with age and albino background and after laser impact preceding retinal degeneration. Raising the albino mice in the dark prevented both events. The appearance of lipid-bloated subretinal MCs was drusen-like on funduscopy of senescent mice, and CX3CR1-dependent MC accumulation was associated with an exacerbation of experimental CNV. These results show that CX3CR1-dependent accumulation of subretinal MCs evokes cardinal features of AMD. These findings reveal what we believe to be a novel pathogenic process with important implications for the development of new therapies for AMD.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: accumulation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: degeneration, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: degeneration, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: express, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: impaired, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: accumulated, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: degeneration, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: accumulated, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: degeneration, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: accumulation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: exacerbation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: CNV, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: accumulation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation</s>"}

In damaged and inflamed tissue, LL-37 functions as a chemoattractant, mitogen and pro-angiogenic factor suggesting that the peptide may potentiate tumor progression. The aim of this study was to characterize the distribution of hCAP-18/LL-37 in normal and cancerous ovarian tissue and to examine the effects of LL-37 on ovarian cancer cells. Expression of hCAP-18/LL-37 was localized to immune and granulosa cells of normal ovarian tissue. By contrast, ovarian tumors displayed significantly higher levels of hCAP-18/LL-37 where expression was observed in tumor and stromal cells. Protein expression was statistically compared to the degree of immune cell infiltration and microvessel density in epithelial-derived ovarian tumors and a significant correlation was observed for both. It was demonstrated that ovarian tumor tissue lysates and ovarian cancer cell lines express hCAP-18/LL-37. Treatment of ovarian cancer cell lines with recombinant LL-37 stimulated proliferation, chemotaxis, invasion and matrix metalloproteinase expression. These data demonstrate for the first time that hCAP-18/LL-37 is significantly overexpressed in ovarian tumors and suggest LL-37 may contribute to ovarian tumorigenesis through direct stimulation of tumor cells, initiation of angiogenesis and recruitment of immune cells. These data provide further evidence of the existing relationship between pro-inflammatory molecules and ovarian cancer progression.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: overexpress, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: overexpress, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: damaged, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: Expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: localized, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: localized, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: localized, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: localized, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: infiltration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: express, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: express, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: chemotaxis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: overexpressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: overexpressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: contribute, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: contribute, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: contribute, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: recruitment, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development</s>"}

Treatment with pharmacological inhibitors and small interfering RNAs reveal that induction and activation of Sp1, HIF1alpha, and Stat3 facilitate their nuclear localization and binding to their specific motifs of the VEGF promoter and induce VEGF expression via two independent pathways, DCN/EGFR/phosphoinositide-3 kinase/AKT and DCN/EGFR/ERK1/2, respectively, in DCN synthesizing MCE cells. The cell type specific glycosylation protects Sp1 and HIF1alpha from proteosome degradation and plays an important and novel role in the regulation of VEGF in DCN transfected MCE cells. Induction of gelatinases (matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9), the serine protease tissue plasminogen activator and plasmin by DCN transfection in MCE cells leads to extracellular proteolysis and to release of matrix-bound VEGF and activation of angiogenesis. In this study, we demonstrate that two independent downstream signal pathways, DCN/EGFR/ERK1/2 and DCN/EGFR/phosphoinositide-3 kinase/AKT, mediate up-regulation and activation of transcription factors

In this study, we investigated the effects of spironolactone on the prevention of corneal allograft rejection in a MHC class I/II mismatch rat corneal transplant model. METHODS: Grafted animals for corneal survival analysis were assigned to receive either spironolactone suspension (orally, 100 mg/kg/day, n = 7), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, orally, same volume as spironolactone, n = 9) or remained untreated (n = 16). Additional grafted rats treated with spironolactone (n = 6) or PBS (n = 8) were sacrificed on day 12 for quantitative RT-PCR analysis for mechanistic studies. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SEM) graft survival was significantly prolonged in animals receiving spironolactone (14.9 +/- 2.0 days) compared with both PBS-treated (12.3 +/- 1.2 days, p = 0.007) and untreated controls (13.0 +/- 1.0 days, p = 0.01). We found a decrease in corneal neovascularization in spironolactone-treated rats compared with the PBS-treated group, although the difference was not statistically significant. Spironolactone affected both systemic (down-regulation of CD25+ cells in spleen) and local immune response (up-regulation of IL-10 in cornea).

METHODS: Patients diagnosed with chronic CSC, with clinical evidence of activity and treated with Photodynamic Therapy, are included in this report. All were assessed by a complete ophthalmological examination, including assessment of the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using an ETDRS chart, fluorescein and indocyanine angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The main objective of the study was to determine the mean visual acuity change. RESULTS: 11 eyes of 11 patients were included in the study, which had a mean follow-up period of 11 months. The mean BCVA increased from 20/76 to 20/64. 35% of eyes improved their BCVA by 2 lines or more, 45% remained stable and 18% lost 2 lines or more. Choroidal hyperpermeability was reduced in every case. Neurosensorial retinal detachment decreased in 80% of cases. Only one eye received a second PDT treatment due to choroidal neovascularization. An increase of atrophy over the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) was observed in another patient. CONCLUSIONS: PDT can reduce the clinical signs of activity, such as choroidal hyperpermeability or neurosensorial retinal detachment, in patients affected by chronic CSC. However, the increase in visual acuity is variable, probably due to the extent of RPE damage.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: improved, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: PDT treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation</s>"}

The antivascular permeability mechanisms deployed by Ang1 are still undefined. Here, we demonstrate that Ang1 halts the ability of VEGF to induce the phosphorylation-dependent redistribution of the adhesion molecule VE-cadherin, thereby rescuing the endothelial barrier function. Ang1 inhibits the activation of Src by VEGF, the most upstream component of the pathway linking VEGF receptors to VE-cadherin internalization. Indeed, Ang1 promotes the activation of mDia through RhoA, resulting in the association of mDia with Src. This ultimately deprives VEGF receptors of an essential molecule required for promoting the disruption of endothelial cell-cell contacts and paracellular permeability.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: prevents, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: sequestering, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: sequestering, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: stabilizes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: protects, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: leakage, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: halts, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: redistribution, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: internalization, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: resulting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: association, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promoting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: disruption, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: cell-cell contacts, Event Type: Binding</s>"}

Vasostatin, the N-terminal domain of calreticulin, is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. In this study, we determined the effectiveness of vasostatin delivered by recombinant pseudotype adeno-associated virus 2/5 (rAAV2/5-VAS) as a gene therapy approach for lung cancer treatment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We used rAAV2/5 to deliver vasostatin intratumorally or systemically in different mouse lung tumor models--subcutaneous, orthotopic xenograft, and spontaneous metastasis lung tumor models. The therapeutic efficacy of rAAV2/5-VAS was determined by monitoring tumor volume, survival rate, and degree of neovascularization after treatment in these models. RESULTS: Mice bearing subcutaneous tumor of rAAV2/5-VAS pretreated Lewis lung carcinoma cells showed >50% reduction in primary tumor volume and reduced spontaneous pulmonary metastases. The tumor-suppressive action of rAAV2/5-VAS in subcutaneous human lung tumor A549 xenograft correlated with a reduced number of capillary vessels in tumors. In the orthotopic xenograft model, rAAV2/5-VAS suppressed metastasis of A549 tumors to mediastinal lymph nodes and contralateral lung. Furthermore, treatment of immunocompetent mice in the spontaneous lung metastases model with rAAV2/5-VAS after primary tumor excision prolonged their median survival from 21 to 51.5 days. CONCLUSION: Our results show the effectiveness of rAAV2/5-VAS as an angiogenesis inhibitor in suppressing tumor growth during different stages of tumor progression, validating the application of rAAV2/5-VAS gene therapy in treatment against lung cancer.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Suppression, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: Suppression, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: suppressing, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressing, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastatic progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: effectiveness, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: delivered, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: gene therapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: deliver, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: deliver, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: pretreated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: metastases, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: tumor-suppressive action, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: tumor-suppressive action, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: excision, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: effectiveness, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: effectiveness, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: suppressing, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressing, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: gene therapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: gene therapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: against, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: against, Event Type: Negative_regulation</s>"}

Treatment involved intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in 0.05 mL) every 6-12 weeks. Treatment was discontinued at patient request or if there was no measurable response to therapy. Main outcome measures included best corrected visual acuity, ophthalmic examination, retinal photography, and angiography. RESULTS: Bevacizumab treatment was followed by reductions in retinal hemorrhage, exudation, and edema. Visual acuities were stable or improved in 86% (n=18). Three patients discontinued therapy. Each was legally blind before treatment (n=1), experienced little to no subjective improvement (n=2), or was poorly compliant (n=2). Three patients (14%) regained 2 or more lines of visual acuity. No ocular or systemic bevacizumab-related side effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Intravitreal bevacizumab can be used to treat radiation retinopathy. In most cases treatment was associated with decreased vascular leakage, stabilization, or improved vision. An anti-vascular endothelial growth factor strategy may reduce tissue damage associated with radiation vasculopathy and neuropathy.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: intravitreal injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: reduce, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: damage, Event Type: Breakdown</s>"}

We tested this using HT-1080, NCI, and Shac fibrosarcoma-derived cell lines and anthrax lethal toxin (LeTx), a bacterial toxin that inactivates MKKs. Western blots confirmed that LeTx treatment reduced the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 MAPK in vitro. Although short treatments with LeTx only modestly affected cell proliferation, sustained treatment markedly reduced cell numbers. LeTx also substantially inhibited the extracellular release of angioproliferative factors including vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-8, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Similar results were obtained with cell lines derived from malignant fibrous histiocytomas, leiomyosarcomas, and liposarcomas. In vivo, LeTx decreased MAPK activity and blocked fibrosarcoma growth. Growth inhibition correlated with decreased cellular proliferation and extensive necrosis, and it was accompanied by a decrease in tumor mean vessel density as well as a reduction in serum expression of angioproliferative cytokines. Vital imaging using high-resolution ultrasound enhanced with contrast microbubbles revealed that the effects of LeTx on tumor perfusion were remarkably rapid ( less than 24 h) and resulted in a marked reduction of perfusion within the tumor but not in nontumor tissues. These results are consistent with our initial hypothesis and lead us to propose that MKK inhibition by LeTx is a broadly effective strategy for targeting neovascularization in fibrosarcomas and other similar proliferative lesions.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: pathways, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: essential, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: essential, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inactivates, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: phosphorylated, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: phosphorylated, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: treatments, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angioproliferative, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: Growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: decrease, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angioproliferative, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: perfusion, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: perfusion, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: targeting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: targeting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

The microcirculation of most tumors includes cooperation of pre-existing vessels, intussusceptive microvascular growth, postnatal vasculogenesis, glomeruloid angiogenesis and vasculogenic mimicry (VM). VM is critical for a tumor blood supply and is asscociated with aggressive features and metastasis. Our studies highlight the plasticity of aggressive human ovarian carcinoma cells and call into question the underlying significance of their ability to form VM in vitro induced by VEGF-a. These studies also show their clinicalpathological features of the cancers with human Paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples. Results show that the process: VEGF-a-- greater than EphA2-- greater than MMPs-- greater than VM is the main pathway for VM formation and VEGF-a appears to play an important role in the formation of VM based on our in vitro assays and clinical immunohistochemical analyses. VM-targeting strategies for ovarian cancer include anti-VEGF-a treatment, knocking down the EphA2 gene and using antibodies against human MMPs if the tumor is VM positive. This strategy may be of significant value in laying the foundation for a more explicit anti-tumor angiogenesis therapy.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: vasculogenic mimicry, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: vasculogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: vasculogenic mimicry, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: VM, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: VM, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: VM, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: VM, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: VM formation, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: play an important role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: formation of VM, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: VM, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: targeting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: knocking down, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: using, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: VM, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: therapy, Event Type: Negative_regulation</s>"}

Here, we investigate the role of TSP-1 in tumor-stroma reaction, which is mainly characterized by fibroblast activation to create a permissive microenvironment for tumor progression. Immunohistochemistry examinations in the human surgical specimens have shown that a downregulation of TSP-1 during the progression of cervical carcinogenesis was accompanied by an emergence in the upregulation of stroma markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and desmin. Transfection of SiHa cervical cancer cells with a plasmid expressing the TSP-1 protein exhibited antiangiogenic activity in vitro and resulted in reduced tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, which was accompanied by a decrease in tumor vascularization and lower expressions of alpha-SMA and desmin than those in the vector controls. Transfection with TSP-1 and purified TSP-1 added to NIH3T3 cells did not alter the protein levels of alpha-SMA and desmin but significantly inhibited matrix metalloprotease-2 activity. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a major factor in the activation of fibroblasts, increased alpha-SMA and desmin expression and the ability of cell migration and invasion in NIH3T3 cells. The increased migration ability and the invasive ability into tumor cluster of TGF-beta-treated NIH3T3 cells were dose dependently inhibited by TSP-1. In contrast, ectopic TSP-1 expression in SiHa cells has little effect on the invasive ability of the NIH3T3 cells. Together, our findings demonstrate a novel role of TSP-1 to inhibit tumor-stroma reaction that could be attributed to the blockage of activated fibroblasts from invading cancer cells.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibiting, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: invading, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: reaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: downregulation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: upregulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: upregulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: upregulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: Transfection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expressing, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: decrease, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: expressions, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expressions, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Transfection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: added, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: alter, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: alter, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: alter, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: alter, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: invasive, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: invasive, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: blockage, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: invading, Event Type: Localization</s>"}

We previously reported that a single dose of ethanol (1.4 g/kg), yielding a blood alcohol concentration of 100 mg/dl, significantly impairs angiogenesis in murine wounds, despite adequate levels of VEGF, suggesting direct effects of ethanol on endothelial cell signaling (40). To examine the mechanism by which ethanol influences angiogenesis in wounds, we employed two different in vitro angiogenesis assays to determine whether acute ethanol exposure (100 mg/dl) would have long-lasting effects on VEGF-induced capillary network formation. Ethanol exposure resulted in reduced VEGF-induced cord formation on collagen and reduced capillary network structure on Matrigel in vitro. In addition, ethanol exposure decreased expression of endothelial VEGF receptor-2, as well as VEGF receptor-2 phosphorylation in vitro. Inhibition of ethanol metabolism by 4-methylpyrazole partially abrogated the effect of ethanol on endothelial cell cord formation. However, mice treated with t-butanol, an alcohol not metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase, exhibited no change in wound vascularity. These results suggest that products of ethanol metabolism are important factors in the development of ethanol-induced changes in endothelial cell responsiveness to VEGF. In vivo, ethanol exposure caused both decreased angiogenesis and increased hypoxia in wounds. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated a direct effect of ethanol on the response to hypoxia in endothelial cells, as ethanol diminished nuclear hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha protein levels. Together, the data establish that acute ethanol exposure significantly impairs angiogenesis and suggest that this effect is mediated by changes in endothelial cell responsiveness to both VEGF and hypoxia.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: disrupts, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: cell signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: regulated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: impairs, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: influences, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: metabolism, Event Type: Metabolism;\nTrigger: abrogated, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: metabolized, Event Type: Metabolism;\nTrigger: metabolized, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: metabolism, Event Type: Metabolism;\nTrigger: important, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: responsiveness, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: diminished, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: impairs, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: responsiveness, Event Type: Regulation</s>"}

SUMMARY: Staging of colorectal cancer occurs after surgery and is based on the extent of disease invasiveness and dissemination. Surgery is the primary treatment for stage I disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended after resection in selected high-risk patients with stage II disease and in all patients with stage III disease. Convenience of administration, tolerability, and patient factors not necessarily age may be considerations in decisions about adjuvant therapy after resection. Treatment of stage IV colorectal cancer is based on the type of prior therapy and patient-specific factors. Recently, significant improvements in survival have been achieved through the use of combination chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody regimens. Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy is first-line therapy for stage IV disease. Age alone should not preclude the use of chemotherapy in stage IV colorectal cancer, although the ability to tolerate drug-related toxicity may be a consideration. The optimal duration of chemotherapy in patients with early and metastatic colorectal cancer is unclear.

Hepatectomy was performed, and the patient is alive and free of disease 1 year postsurgery. Grossly, the tumour showed a haemorrhagic cut surface with numerous microcystic structures. Histological examination revealed cystic or angiomatoid spaces of various sizes lined by cuboidal, low-columnar, or flattened epithelioid cells with vacuolated cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei. The epithelioid cells were entirely supported by proliferated capillaries and arteries together with collagenous stroma. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the epithelioid cells were strongly positive for a broad spectrum of cytokeratins (AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, epithelial membrane antigen and cytokeratin 7) and mesothelial markers (calretinin, Wilms' tumour 1 and D2-40). These cells were negative for Hep par-1, carcinoembryonic antigen, neural cell adhesion molecule, CD34, CD31 and HMB45.

Furthermore, some published studies reporting the antiangiogenic effects of endostatin-derived peptides were also reviewed.

The importance of NO in the vasculature is demonstrated by several experimental conditions, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced angiogenesis. Thus, the NO metabolic pathway in endothelial cells could be one of the main contributing factors for angiogenesis. Although several methods have been used for measuring in vitro angiogenesis, a proper technique has not been developed for identifying in vivo NO-dependent angiogenesis. This chapter provides a new intravital microscopic method for detecting and measuring NO-dependent angiogenesis in a mouse model. This technique showed strong abdominal neovascularization in wild-type mice, but not eNOS knockout mice, locally injected with VEGF, as well as stimulation of angiogenesis in NO donor-injected mice. This technique also revealed the inhibitory effect of the NOS inhibitor N(G)-iminoethyl-L-ornithine in VEGF-mediated in vivo angiogenesis.

Results were analyzed with chi2 tests. Comparisons of presymposium and postsymposium responses and between the 2 groups of attendees indicated that the pediatric dentistry and endodontic communities agree that formocresol will be replaced as a primary tooth pulpotomy agent, that mineral trioxide is the first choice to take its place, that IPT in primary teeth holds hope as a replacement for pulpotomy, and that IPT is an acceptable pulp therapy technique for cariously involved young permanent teeth.

METHODS: To evaluate antiangiogenic activity of cRGD-HL, we performed tests on endothelial cell adhesion and migration to vitronectin, tube formation, binding affinity to purified alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, and in vivo Matrigel plug assay. The antitumor activity of cRGD-HL was also evaluated by monitoring tumor growth and microvessel formation in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC7) tumor. RESULTS: The cRGD-HL significantly inhibited adhesion and migration of endothelial cells to vitronectin, and tubular structures of endothelial cells. Compared to cRGDyK and HL, cRGD-HL has high binding affinity to purified alpha(v)beta(3) integrin. The enhanced antiangiogenic effect of cRGD-HL was confirmed in Matrigel assay by showing the significant inhibition of bFGF-driven angiogenesis and blood vessel formation. It was thought that potent antiangiogenic effect of cRGD-HL was probably due to the interference of alpha(v)beta(3)-mediated interaction, resulting in the enhanced antitumoral activity against SCC7 tumor. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrated that cRGD-modified heparin derivative enhanced anti-angiotherapeutic effects against solid tumor, and therefore, it could be applied to treat various cancers and angiogenic diseases as a potent angiogenesis inhibitor.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: targeted, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: targeted, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: driven, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: interference, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: against, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: treat, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

A high TP expression at tumor sites is correlated with tumor growth, induction of angiogenesis, and metastasis. Therefore, high TP is most likely associated with a poor prognosis. TP is not only expressed in tumor cells but also in tumor surrounding tissues, such as tumor infiltrating macrophages. TP catalyzes the conversion of thymidine to thymine and doxyribose-1-phosphate (dR-1-P). The latter in its parent form or in its sugar form, deoxyribose (dR) may play a role in the induction of angiogenesis. It may modulate cellular energy metabolism or be a substrate in a chemical reaction generating reactive oxygen species. L-deoxyribose (L-dR) and thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) can reverse these effects.

METHODS: Transplant tumor model was induced by subcutaneous inoculation of 2 x 10(6) Lewis lung cancer (LLC) cells into the back of C57BL/6 mice. The mice were treated by intratumoral injection of 2 x 10(9) pfu Ad-mEndostatin. The expression of endostatin in situ and its maintaining time were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western Blot, respectively. The endostatin level in serum was determined by ELISA . The inhibition of tumor growth and changes of survival were recorded and the microvessel density (MVD) was determined by histochemical stainingwith CD31 and CD105 antibodies. The tumor apoptosis was observed by electron microscopy. RESULTS: In comparison with controls, intratumoral injection of Ad-mEndostatin significantly inhibited the tumor growth and metastasis, and prolonged the survival rate of mice (P  less than  0.05). Strong positive expression of mEndostatin was seen in the tumor tissue after injection of Ad-mEndostatin, immunhistochemically ostained by mouse endostatin monoclonal antibody, while the control groups showed only very low expression or absence. Serum endostatin concentration was 1540 +/- 560 ng/ml at the second week of administration, the expression of endostatin diminished a month later. The microvessel density (MVD)) decreased from 42.4 +/- 4.8 to 10.5 +/- 3.2 per x 200 magnificetion microscopic field by CD10 staining and from 68.5 +/- 4.5 to 37.5 +/- 4.6 by CD31 staining, respectively (P  less than  0.05). More apoptotic tumor cells were seen under the transmission electron microscope. CONCLUSION: Endostatin gene therapy mediated by adenoviral vector efficiently induces expression of endostatin in vivo, and inhibits the growth and metastasis of tumor.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: gene transfer, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: transplanted, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: gene transfer, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: transplanted, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: Transplant, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: subcutaneous inoculation, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: intratumoral injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: apoptosis, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: intratumoral injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: prolonged, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: survival, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: absence, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: administration, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: diminished, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: apoptotic, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: gene therapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization</s>"}

However, it remains unknown whether or not allogeneic transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from fetal membranes (FM), which are generally discarded as medical waste after delivery, has therapeutic potential. FM-MSC were obtained from Lewis rats and had surface antigen expression and multipotent potential partly similar to those of BM-MSC. Compared with BM-MSC, FM-MSC secreted a comparable amount of hepatocyte growth factor despite a small amount of vascular endothelial growth factor. FM-MSC and BM-MSC both expressed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I but not MHC class II antigens and did not elicit allogeneic lymphocyte proliferation in mixed lymphocyte culture. FM-MSC or BM-MSC obtained from Lewis rats were injected into a MHC-mismatched August-Copenhagen-Irish rat model of hind limb ischemia. Three weeks after injection, blood perfusion and capillary density were significantly higher in the FM-MSC and BM-MSC groups than in the phosphate-buffered saline group, and allogeneic FM-MSC and BM-MSC were still observed. In nonischemic hind limb tissues, allogeneic FM-MSC and BM-MSC injection were associated with a comparatively small amount of T lymphocyte infiltration, compared with the injection of allogeneic splenic lymphocytes. In conclusion, allogeneic FM-MSC injection did not elicit a lymphocyte proliferative response and provided significant improvement in a rat model of hind limb ischemia, comparable to the response to BM-MSC. Thus, allogeneic injection of FM-MSC may be a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of severe peripheral vascular disease.

In vivo and in vitro results.\n\nOBJECTIVE: We transfected ovarian cancer cells and administered recombinant plasmid encoding hPNAS-4 to nude mice bearing ovarian cancer, aiming to evaluate the effect of hPNAS-4 against ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: Ovarian cancer SKOV3 cells were transfected with hPNAS-4-plasmid, and cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay; apoptosis was examined by DNA ladder, Hoechst33258 staining and flow-cytometric assays. Nude mice bearing ovarian cancers were treated with hPNAS-4-p/liposome. Tumor growth was determined and survival was recorded. TUNEL assay and microvessel density was assessed to evaluate apoptosis and angiogenesis. RESULTS: Both inhibition of proliferation (p < 0.05) and induction of apoptosis (p < 0.05) were observed in SKOV3 cells transfected with hPNAS-4-p in vitro. In hPNAS-4-p-treated tumor cells in vivo, tumor growth significantly decreased, while the survival time of tumor-bearing mice was prolonged compared with control groups (p < 0.05). Increased apoptosis of tumor cells and decreased angiogenesis in tumor tissue were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our promising results on the potential antitumor effects of hPNAS-4 on ovarian cancer in vitro and in vivo may be explained, in part, by the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis.

Its control of growth factor signaling usually involves interactions with the heparan sulfate chains covalently coupled to the protein core's N-terminus. However, this modular protein core also binds with relatively high affinity to a number of growth factors and surface receptors, thereby stabilizing cell-matrix links. This review will focus on perlecan-growth factor interactions and describe recent advances in our understanding of this highly conserved proteoglycan during development, cancer growth, and angiogenesis. The pro-angiogenic capacities of perlecan that involve proliferative and migratory signals in response to bound growth factors will be explored, as well as the anti-angiogenic signals resulting from interactions between the C-terminal domain known as endorepellin and integrins that control adhesion of cells to the extracellular matrix. These two somewhat diametrically opposed roles will be discussed in light of new data emerging from various fields which converge on perlecan as a key regulator of cell growth and angiogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: interactions, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: bound, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: signals, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: resulting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: interactions, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: control, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

VEGF is a potent activator of angiogenesis as it promotes endothelial cell proliferation and new blood vessel formation. Previously, we reported that in vitro M-CSF induces the expression of biologically-active VEGF from human monocytes. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: In this study, we demonstrate the molecular mechanism of M-CSF-induced VEGF production. Using a construct containing the VEGF promoter linked to a luciferase reporter, we found that a mutation reducing HIF binding to the VEGF promoter had no significant effect on luciferase production induced by M-CSF stimulation. Further analysis revealed that M-CSF induced VEGF through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway via the transcription factor, Sp1. Thus, inhibition of either ERK or Sp1 suppressed M-CSF-induced VEGF at the mRNA and protein level. M-CSF also induced the nuclear localization of Sp1, which was blocked by ERK inhibition. Finally, mutating the Sp1 binding sites within the VEGF promoter or inhibiting ERK decreased VEGF promoter activity in M-CSF-treated human monocytes. To evaluate the biological significance of M-CSF induced VEGF production, we used an in vivo angiogenesis model to illustrate the ability of M-CSF to recruit mononuclear phagocytes, increase VEGF levels, and enhance angiogenesis. Importantly, the addition of a neutralizing VEGF antibody abolished M-CSF-induced blood vessel formation. CONCLUSION: These data delineate an ERK- and Sp1-dependent mechanism of M-CSF induced VEGF production and demonstrate for the first time the ability of M-CSF to induce angiogenesis via VEGF in vivo.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: signals, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: recruits, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulate, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulate, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: metastases, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: activator, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: linked, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: reducing, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: signaling pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: localization, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: mutating, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: inhibiting, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: ability, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: recruit, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhance, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: abolished, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), one of the most potent angiogenic factors, stimulates endothelial cell proliferation and induces the angiogenesis. Recently, considerable attentions have been devoted to the physiological roles of angiopoietin (Ang)-1 and -2 as regulatory factors of VEGF. Ang-1 has been shown to induce the migration and sprouting of endothelial cells, and coexpression of Ang-1 and VEGF enhanced angiogenesis. In the presence of high levels of VEGF, Ang-2 also promotes rapid increase in capillary diameter, remodeling of the basal lamina, proliferation and migration of endothelial cells, and stimulates sprouting of new blood vessels. Thus, VEGF, Ang-1 and -2 may play complementary and coordinated roles in airway angiogenesis and microvascular remodeling, and these structural changes are potentially reversible by therapeutic intervention. The scope of the present review is to discuss from a clinical point of view the potential interactions between VEGF and angiopoietins in the asthmatic airways, and focus on the therapeutic implications targeting for these angiogenic factors. Recently, there is an increasing number of patents which have been focused on the inhibitors of VEGF action. These inhibitors are directed towards the receptors of VEGF or intracellular substrates for the receptors. We will also discuss several patents regarding inhibitors of VEGF action in the present review.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: stimulates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: sprouting, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: coexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: presence, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: sprouting, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: play complementary and coordinated roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: play complementary and coordinated roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: play complementary and coordinated roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: play complementary and coordinated roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: play complementary and coordinated roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: play complementary and coordinated roles, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: interactions, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

A previous study showed that the expression of COUP-TFII enhanced invasiveness of human lung carcinoma cells. However, no published data are available concerning the biological and clinical significance of COUP-TFII expression in colorectal cancer. Thus, our objective was to explore the expression of COUP-TFII in colorectal cancer as well as its association with clinicopathological features, and to evaluate the role of COUP-TFII as a prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer. We investigated the presence of COUP-TFII in human colorectal cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from 95 primary colorectal cancer patients by immunohistochemistry. The correlation between the expression of COUP-TFII and clinicopathologic features was investigated. The 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with tumors expressing different levels of COUP-TFII were evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method. No significant correlation was found between COUP-TFII expression and age at surgery, gender, histopathologic differentiation, vessel invasion, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), or nodal involvement. However, survival analysis showed that the COUP-TFII-positive group had a significantly better OS compared to COUP-TFII-negative group (80.4% vs. 57.7%, P=0.0491).

Stimulation of tumor angiogenesis was connected with about 2-fold increase in intracellular level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antioxidant N-acetyl-l-aspartate (NAC) decreased vessels number in tumors formed by cells with inactivated p53 and inhibited their growth.

Estrogen is crucial in breast carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Whether sex steroids affect IL-8 secretion of normal breast tissue or breast cancer is not known. Several cell types in a tissue secrete IL-8. Hence, regulatory mechanisms of IL-8 need to be investigated in whole tissue. We used microdialysis to sample IL-8 in normal human breast tissue in situ in pre- and postmenopausal women, preoperatively in breast cancers of women, and in experimental breast cancer in mice. We found a significant positive correlation between IL-8 and estradiol in normal breast tissue and hormone-dependent breast cancer in vivo. Ex vivo, estradiol exposure increased the IL-8 secretion of normal whole breast tissue in culture. In experimental breast cancer, estradiol increased IL-8 whereas the anti-estrogen tamoxifen inhibited the secretion of IL-8 both in vitro and extracellularly in vivo in tumors of nude mice. An anti-IL-8 Ab inhibited endothelial cell proliferation induced by cancer cell produced IL-8 and tumors with low IL-8 levels exhibited decreased angiogenesis. Our results strongly suggest that estradiol has a critical role in the regulation of IL-8 in normal human breast tissue and human breast cancer.

However, the underlying mechanism is poorly understood. Phosphatase and tension homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), a tumor suppressor, is frequently deficient in various pathologies due to mutation or epigenetic alterations. PTEN promoter hypermethylation is a major epigenetic silencing mechanism leading to activation of angiogenesis in tumors. The present study aimed to investigate whether PTEN promoter methylation was involved in CCMs. METHODS: PTEN promoter methylation was detected in surgical specimens of CCMs (n=69) by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. The methylation status was correlated to the clinical manifestations and to PTEN expression, which was analyzed by both Western blot and immunohistochemistry. To investigate the endothelial proliferation and the potential signaling pathways affected by PTEN methylation, proliferating cell nuclear antigen as well as phosphor-Akt and phosphor-Erk1,2 were detected by immunofluorescence and Western blot, respectively, in CCM specimens. RESULTS: Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction revealed PTEN promoter methylation in 15.9% CCMs. Strikingly, 5 of 6 familial CCMs showed PTEN promoter methylation (83.3%), which was significantly higher than in sporadic cases (9.4%; P<0.001). In addition, PTEN promoter methylation appeared more frequently in multiple CCMs, including familial cases (46.7%), than that in single-lesioned CCMs (11.8%; P<0.05). Immunostaining and Western blot revealed a more significant PTEN downregulation in PTEN-methylated CCMs in comparison to PTEN-unmethylated CCMs. Reduced PTEN expression was inversely correlated to the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and to the activation of Erk1,2, but not of Akt.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most critical factors that induce angiogenesis and has thus become an attractive target for antiangiogenesis treatment. However, most current anti-VEGF agents often cause some side effects when given chronically. Identification of naturally occurring VEGF inhibitors derived from diet would be one alternative approach with an advantage of known safety. Grape seed extract (GSE), a widely used dietary supplement, is known to have antitumor activity. In this study, we have explored the activity of GSE on VEGF receptor and angiogenesis. We found that GSE could directly inhibit the kinase activity of purified VEGF receptor 2, a novel activity of GSE that has not been characterized. GSE could also inhibit the VEGF receptor/mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated signaling pathway in endothelial cells. As a result, GSE could inhibit VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation and migration as well as sprout formation from aorta ring. In vivo assay further showed that GSE could inhibit tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in mice. Consistent with the in vitro data, GSE treatment of tumor-bearing mice led to concomitant reduction of blood vessel density and phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Depletion of polyphenol with polyvinylpyrrolidone abolished the antiangiogenic activity of GSE, suggesting a water-soluble fraction of polyphenol in GSE is responsible for the antiangiogenic activity. Taken together, this study indicates that GSE is a well-tolerated and inexpensive natural VEGF inhibitor and could potentially be useful in cancer prevention or treatment.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: suppression, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: Blockade, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: prevention, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: led, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: led, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reduction, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: Depletion, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: abolished, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: responsible, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: prevention, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

Loss of tumor suppressor proteins, which function as brakes on cell growth, migration, or cell survival, was recognized early on as an important mechanism for initiation and progression of melanoma. Semaphorins and their cognate receptors, Plexins and neuropilins, are involved in neuronal pathfinding, immune function, and tumor progression through effects on blood vessel growth and cell migration. Semaphorin 7A (Sema7A) is a membrane-linked semaphorin that is expressed by human keratinocytes, and we have shown that Sema7A binds to human melanocytes through beta1-integrins and the Plexin C1 receptor. Functional studies showed that Sema7A stimulates cytoskeletal reorganization in human melanocytes, resulting in adhesion and dendrite formation. Downstream targets of Plexin C1 signaling in human melanocytes include cofilin and LIM kinase II, both of which are critical mediators of cell adhesion and migration. In this report, we analyzed the expression of Plexin C1 using immunohistochemistry on sections of primary and matched metastatic lesions from 19 subjects and in a large melanoma tumor microarray. Our data show a significant loss of Plexin C1 in metastatic melanoma compared with primary melanoma, suggesting the possibility that the Plexin C1 receptor is a tumor suppressor protein for melanoma.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: transformation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: brakes, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: brakes, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: brakes, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: survival, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: through, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: through, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: through, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: through, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: linked, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: binds, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: binds, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: binds, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: stimulates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reorganization, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: resulting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: resulting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: dendrite formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: targets, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: targets, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression</s>"}

To examine whether IFI16 induction might be extended to other proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, we used the strategy of the RNA interference to knock down IFI16 expression, and analyze the capability of TNF-alpha to stimulate intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1 or CD54) expression in the absence of functional IFI16.

These antivascular actions are due in part to direct effects on endothelial cells, and all MBDs (both microtubule-stabilizing and microtubule-destabilizing) inhibit endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and tube formation in vitro, actions that are thought to correspond to therapeutic antiangiogenic actions. In addition, the microtubule-destabilizing agents cause prominent changes in endothelial cell morphology, an action associated with rapid vascular collapse in vivo. The effects on endothelial cells occur in vitro at low drug concentrations, which do not affect microtubule gross morphology, do not cause microtubule bundling or microtubule loss and do not induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or cell death. Rather, it has been hypothesized that, at low concentrations, MBDs produce more subtle effects on microtubule dynamics, block critical cell signaling pathways, and prevent the microtubules from properly interacting with transient subcellular assemblies (focal adhesions and adherens junctions) whose subsequent stabilization and/or maturation are required for cell motility and cell-cell interactions. This review will focus on recent studies to define the molecular mechanisms for the antivascular actions of the MBDs, information that could be useful in the identification or design of agents whose actions more selectively target the tumor vasculature.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: actions, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: chemotherapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: disrupting, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: properties, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: actions, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: actions, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: cause, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: collapse, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: affect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: cause, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: cause, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: bundling, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: loss, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: apoptosis, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: death, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: prevent, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: interacting, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: stabilization, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: stabilization, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: maturation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: maturation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: required, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: motility, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: interactions, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: actions, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: target, Event Type: Regulation</s>"}

Recent data suggest that activation of the integrin-associated protein CD47 promotes neuronal cell death. Is it possible that CD47 may also negatively affect cerebral endothelial cells? Exposure of wild-type primary mouse cerebral endothelial cells to the CD47 ligand thrombospondin 1 (TSP-1) induced an increasing amount of cell death, whereas cytotoxicity was significantly decreased in cerebral endothelial cells derived from CD47 knockout mice. The specific CD47-activating peptide, 4N1K, similarly induced cell death in human brain microvascular endothelial cells. Promotion of inflammation was also involved because lower TSP-1 was able to up-regulate the adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. Finally, CD47 signaling may suppress angiogenesis because 4N1K significantly inhibited endothelial cell migration and tube formation in vitro. We conclude that CD47 signaling can negatively affect the viability and function of cerebral endothelial cells, further supporting the notion that CD47 may be a potential neurovascular target for stroke and brain injury.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: promotion, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: death, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: suppression, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: death, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: negatively affect, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: Exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: death, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: knockout, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: activating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: cell death, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: up-regulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: up-regulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: suppress, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: negatively affect, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: injury, Event Type: Breakdown</s>"}

The cells subsequently proliferate and differentiate to form endothelial tubes and capillary-like structures. Little is known about the metabolic adaptation of endothelial cells through such a transformation. We studied the metabolic changes of endothelial cell activation by growth factors using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), [1,2-(13)C(2)]-glucose and mass isotopomer distribution analysis. The metabolism of [1,2-(13)C(2)]-glucose by HUVEC allows us to trace many of the main glucose metabolic pathways, including glycogen synthesis, the pentose cycle and the glycolytic pathways. So we established that these pathways were crucial to endothelial cell proliferation under vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) stimulation. A specific VEGF receptor-2 inhibitor demonstrated the importance of glycogen metabolism and pentose cycle pathway. Furthermore, we showed that glycogen was depleted in a low glucose medium, but conserved under hypoxic conditions. Finally, we demonstrated that direct inhibition of key enzymes to glycogen metabolism and pentose phosphate pathways reduced HUVEC viability and migration. In this regard, inhibitors of these pathways have been shown to be effective antitumoral agents. To sum up, our data suggest that the inhibition of metabolic pathways offers a novel and powerful therapeutic approach, which simultaneously inhibits tumor cell proliferation and tumor-induced angiogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: Angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: repair, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: recruiting, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: proliferate, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: differentiate, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: form, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: form, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: transformation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: changes, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: metabolism, Event Type: Metabolism;\nTrigger: metabolic pathways, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: synthesis, Event Type: Synthesis;\nTrigger: cycle, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: glycolytic pathways, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: metabolism, Event Type: Metabolism;\nTrigger: cycle pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: depleted, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: metabolism, Event Type: Metabolism;\nTrigger: phosphate pathways, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with cisplatin and endothelial cell migration analyzed by fluorescence and scratch-wound migration assay. MMP2 and MMP9 activity were determined by zymographic assay, and MAPK activation by Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that cisplatin provoked a time- and dose-dependent decrease of HUVEC migration; this effect was clearly independent from its well known cytotoxic activity. In addition, cisplatin markedly reduced MMP2 activity in both conditioned media and cell lysates, increased p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation, but did not affect ERK phosphorylation. Endothelial cell migration was attenuated by treatment of cells with GM6001, a non-specific inhibitor of MMPs, or by a selective anti-MMP2 antibody. However, treatment of cells with SB202190 or SP600125, inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JNK respectively, did not affect HUVEC migration.

The recent demonstration that VEGF signaling is modulated by the Notch signaling pathway, however, suggests that inhibiting Notch signaling may enhance regional neovascularization, by altering the responsiveness of local endothelial cells to angiogenic stimuli. We tested this possibility with in vitro assays using human endothelial cells, as well as in a rodent hindlimb ischemia model. Treatment of cultured human endothelial cells with DAPT, a gamma secretase inhibitor, increased cell migration and sprout formation in response to VEGF stimulation with a biphasic dependence on DAPT concentration. Further, delivery of an appropriate combination of DAPT and VEGF from an injectable alginate hydrogel system into ischemic hindlimbs led to a faster recovery of blood flow than VEGF or DAPT alone; perfusion levels reached 80% of the normal level by week 4 with combined DAPT and VEGF delivery.

METHODS: Bovine aortic endothelial cells (ECs) were cultured. The expression of SREBP and Cdc42 were determined by Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR. Moreover, outward growth migration model and transwell chamber assay were used to detect ECs migration. RESULTS: (1) SREBP was activated during ECs migration. Western blot analysis demonstrated increased active form SREBP in migrating as compared to non-migrating ECs population. SREBP activation decreased as ECs migration slowed;(2) Coincidental with SREBP activation, mRNA expression of its target genes such as low density lipoprotein receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, and fatty acid synthase also increased in migrating ECs population as detected by real-time PCR; (3) Migration induced SREBP activation in ECs was inhibited by SREBP-acting protein RNAi and pharmacologically by 25-hydroxycholesterol; (4) Inhibition of SREBP led to decreased ECs migration in various models; (5) Cells genetically deficient in SREBP-acting protein, S1P, or S2P, phenotypically exhibited impaired migration; (6) SREBP inhibition in ECs suppressed the activity of small GTPase Cdc42, a key molecule for ECs motility. CONCLUSIONS: SREBP is activated during and plays a critical role in ECs migration. Targeting SREBP could become a novel approach in fighting diseases involving abnormal ECs migration.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: involvement, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: critical role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: cultured, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migrating, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: non-migrating, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: slowed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mRNA expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: mRNA expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: mRNA expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migrating, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: Migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: led, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: deficient, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: deficient, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: deficient, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: suppressed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: motility, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: plays a critical role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: Targeting, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization</s>"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the specific role of TF in the esophageal cancer microenvironment. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: An Affymetrix expression microarray was used to compare gene expression profiles between six pairs of TFs and normal fibroblasts from esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Differentially expressed genes were identified, and a subset was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: About 43% (126 of 292) of known deregulated genes in TFs were associated with cell proliferation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and immune response. Up-regulation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2), which showed the most significant change, was detected in all six tested TFs compared with their paired normal fibroblasts. A further study found that FGFR2-positive fibroblasts were only observed inside the tumor tissues and not in tumor-surrounding stromal tissues, suggesting that FGFR2 could be used as a TF-specific marker in ESCC. Moreover, the conditioned medium from TFs was found to be able to promote ESCC tumor cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides new candidate genes for the esophageal cancer microenvironment. Based on our results, we hypothesize that FGFR2(+)-TFs might provide cancer cells with a suitable microenvironment via secretion of proteins that could promote cancer development and progression through stimulation of cancer cell proliferation, induction of angiogenesis, inhibition of cell adhesion, enhancement of cell mobility, and promotion of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: play an essential role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: interactions, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: remodeling, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: Up-regulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: invasion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: enhancement, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mobility, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: promotion, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promotion, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: transition, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: transition, Event Type: Development</s>"}

Endothelialisation and platelet adhesion to purified endothelial cell-derived perlecan, the major heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycan in basement membranes, were investigated using in vivo and in vitro assays. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular grafts were coated with perlecan and tested in an ovine carotid interposition model for a period of 6 weeks and assessed using light and scanning microscopy. Enhanced endothelial cell growth and reduced platelet adhesion were observed on the perlecan coated grafts when compared to uncoated controls implanted in the same sheep (n=5). Perlecan was also found to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation in vitro over a period of 6 days in the presence of plasma proteins and fibroblastic growth factor 2 (FGF-2), however in the absence of FGF-2 endothelial cell growth could not be maintained during this period. Perlecan was found to be anti-adhesive for platelets, however after removal of the HS chains attached to perlecan, platelet adhesion and aggregation were supported. These results suggest a role for HS chains of perlecan in improving graft patency by selectively promoting endothelial cell proliferation while modulating platelet adhesion.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: modulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: modulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: Controlled, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: neo-endothelialisation, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Endothelialisation, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: coated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: Enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: coated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: uncoated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: implanted, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: implanted, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: stimulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: presence, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: absence, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: anti-adhesive, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: aggregation, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: promoting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: modulating, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding</s>"}

Neovascularization is associated with mechanical strain-dependent induction of angiogenic factors such as CCN1, an immediate-early gene-encoded matricellular molecule critical for vascular development and repair. Here we have demonstrated that mechanical strain-dependent induction of the CCN1 gene involves signaling cascades through RhoA-mediated actin remodeling and the p38 stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK). Actin signaling controls serum response factor (SRF) activity via SRF interaction with the myocardin-related transcriptional activator (MRTF)-A and tethering to a single CArG box sequence within the CCN1 promoter. Such activity was abolished in mechanically stimulated mouse MRTF-A(-/-) cells or upon inhibition of CREB-binding protein (CBP) histone acetyltransferase (HAT) either pharmacologically or by siRNAs. Mechanical strain induced CBP-mediated acetylation of histones 3 and 4 at the SRF-binding site and within the CCN1 gene coding region. Inhibition of p38 SAPK reduced CBP HAT activity and its recruitment to the SRF.MRTF-A complex, whereas enforced induction of p38 by upstream activators (e.g. MKK3 and MKK6) enhanced both CBP HAT and CCN1 promoter activities. Similarly, mechanical overload-induced CCN1 gene expression in vivo was associated with nuclear localization of MRTF-A and enrichment of the CCN1 promoter with both MRTF-A and acetylated histone H3. Taken together, these data suggest that signal-controlled activation of SRF, MRTF-A, and CBP provides a novel connection between mechanical stimuli and angiogenic gene expression.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: requires, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: requires, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: respond, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: critical, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: critical, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: repair, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: controls, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: controls, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: via, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: via, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: acetylation, Event Type: Acetylation;\nTrigger: acetylation, Event Type: Acetylation;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: recruitment, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: localization, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: acetylated, Event Type: Acetylation;\nTrigger: controlled, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: controlled, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: controlled, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

The presence of microvascular proliferation leads to the histological diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme. Tumour angiogenesis involves multiple cellular processes including endothelial cell proliferation, migration, reorganisation of extracellular matrix and tube formation. These processes are regulated by numerous pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic growth factors. Angiogenesis inhibitors have been developed to interrupt the angiogenic process at the growth factor, receptor tyrosine kinase and intracellular kinase levels. Other anti-angiogenic therapies alter the immune response and endogeneous angiogenesis inhibitor levels. Most anti-angiogenic therapies for malignant gliomas are in Phase I/II trials and only modest efficacies are reported for monotherapies.

Here, we show that natural and synthetic progestins also induce thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) mRNA and protein in T47-D and BT-474 breast cancer cells. Antiprogestin RU-486 inhibits the induction of VEGF and TSP-1 by progestins, suggesting that this effect of progestin is mediated by the progesterone receptor (PR). Actinomycin-D, but not puromycin, also blocks progestin-dependent induction of TSP-1. A putative progestin-response element was identified in the human TSP-1 promoter, which is consistent with the hypothesis that a progestin-PR complex might directly regulate transcription of the TSP-1 gene in human cells. Conditioned medium from progestin-treated breast cancer cells stimulates endothelial cell proliferation in the absence though not in the presence of antibody to TSP-1, indicating that TSP-1 secreted by breast cancer cells could be pro-angiogenic. Since tumor cell-derived TSP-1 has the potential to promote angiogenesis in the tumor microenvironment, it could be a potential target for breast cancer therapy.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: express, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mediated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: blocks, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: blocks, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: regulate, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: regulate, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: transcription, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: stimulates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: secreted, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: therapy, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

Studies were therefore performed with PECAM-1-null mice to further define the involvement of PECAM-1 in blood vessel formation. Vascularization of subcutaneous Matrigel implants as well as tumor angiogenesis were both inhibited in PECAM-1-null mice. Reciprocal bone marrow transplants that involved both wild-type and PECAM-1-deficient mice revealed that the impaired angiogenic response resulted from a loss of endothelial, but not leukocyte, PECAM-1. In vitro wound migration and single-cell motility by PECAM-1-null endothelial cells were also compromised. In addition, filopodia formation, a feature of motile cells, was inhibited in PECAM-1-null endothelial cells as well as in human endothelial cells treated with either anti-PECAM-1 antibody or PECAM-1 siRNA. Furthermore, the expression of PECAM-1 promoted filopodia formation and increased the protein expression levels of Cdc42, a Rho GTPase that is known to promote the formation of filopodia. In the developing retinal vasculature, numerous, long filamentous filopodia, emanating from endothelial cells at the tips of angiogenic sprouts, were observed in wild-type animals, but to a lesser extent in the PECAM-1-null mice. Together, these data further establish the involvement of endothelial PECAM-1 in angiogenesis and suggest that, in vivo, PECAM-1 may stimulate endothelial cell motility by promoting the formation of filopodia.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: null, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inhibit, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: null, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: involvement, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: Vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: null, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: transplants, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: deficient, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: impaired, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: impaired, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: loss, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: loss, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: motility, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: promoted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: developing, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: null, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: involvement, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: stimulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: motility, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: promoting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development</s>"}

High expression of c-Ski has been found in some cancers, including gastric cancer. We previously showed that disruption of TGF-beta signaling by dominant-negative TGF-beta type II receptor in a diffuse-type gastric carcinoma model accelerated tumor growth through induction of tumor angiogenesis by decreased expression of the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin (TSP)-1. Here, we examined the function of c-Ski in human diffuse-type gastric carcinoma OCUM-2MLN cells. Overexpression of c-Ski inhibited TGF-beta signaling in OCUM-2MLN cells. Interestingly, c-Ski overexpression resulted in extensive acceleration of the growth of subcutaneous xenografts in BALB/c nu/nu female mice (6 weeks of age). Similar to tumors expressing dominant-negative TGF-beta type II receptor, histochemical studies revealed less fibrosis and increased angiogenesis in xenografted tumors expressing c-Ski compared to control tumors. Induction of TSP-1 mRNA by TGF-beta was attenuated by c-Ski in vitro, and expression of TSP-1 mRNA was decreased in tumors expressing c-Ski in vivo. These findings suggest that c-Ski overexpression promotes the growth of diffuse-type gastric carcinoma through induction of angiogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: disruption, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: accelerated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: expressing, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: expressing, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: attenuated, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expressing, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

Directed EC migration is a central step in this process and depends on cellular signaling cascades that initiate and control the structural rearrangements. On the basis of earlier findings that ERK5 deficiency in mouse EC results in massive defects in vessel architecture, we focused on the impact of the MEK5/ERK5 signaling pathway on EC migration. Using a retroviral gene transfer approach, we found that constitutive activation of MEK5/ERK5 signaling strongly inhibits EC migration and results in massive morphological changes. The area covered by spread EC was dramatically enlarged, accompanied by an increase in focal contacts and altered organization of actin filaments. Consequently, cells were more rigid and show reduced motility. This phenotype was most likely based on decreased focal contact turnover caused by reduced expression of p130Cas, a key player in directed cell migration. We demonstrate for the first time that ERK5 signaling not only is involved in EC survival and stress response but also controls migration and morphology of EC.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: requires, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: requires, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: restructuring, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: restructuring, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: deficiency, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: results, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: defects, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: impact, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: signaling pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: spread, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: organization, Event Type: Remodeling;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: motility, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: signaling, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: involved, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: survival, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: controls, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: controls, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization</s>"}

We previously reported that VEGF induces DSCR-1s expression in endothelial cells, which in turn negatively feeds back to attenuate endothelial cell activation. Here, in order to characterize the role of the promoter that drives DSCR-1s expression in mediating inducible expression in vivo and to determine the functional relevance of DSCR-1s in inflammation, we targeted a DNA construct containing 1.7 kb of the human DSCR1s promoter coupled to the lacZ reporter to the hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt) locus of mice. We determined that lacZ was uniformly expressed in the endothelium of transgenic embryos but was markedly downregulated postnatally. Systemic administration of VEGF or LPS in adult mice resulted in cyclosporine A-sensitive reactivation of the DSCR1s promoter and endogenous gene expression in a subset of organs, including the heart and brain.

In a mouse model of endotoxemia, DSCR-1s-deficient mice demonstrated increased sepsis mortality, whereas adenovirus-mediated DSCR-1s overexpression protected against LPS-induced lethality.

Among a myriad of biological activities described for xanthone derivatives, the anticancer activity is quite remarkable, but the molecular mechanism is not clearly resolved. In the present study, we investigated the antiangiogenic mechanism of 3,6-di(2,3-epoxypropoxy)xanthone (EPOX), a novel Mcl-1 targeting drug. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: To evaluate the antiangiogenic activity of EPOX, we did cell viability, cell cycle, tube formation assay in vitro, and Matrigel plug assay in vivo. To evaluate the effect of EPOX on the endothelial signaling pathway, we did immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence analysis. Intracellular glutathione levels were determined with the use of monochlorobimane, a glutathione-specific probe. RESULTS: EPOX induced endothelial cell apoptosis in association with proteasome-dependent Mcl-1 degradation. Down-regulation of Mcl-1 resulted in an increase in Mcl-1-free Bim, activation of Bax, and then signaling of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. Additionally, glutathione depletion and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inactivation was observed in EPOX-treated cells. Glutathione supplementation reversed the inhibitory effects of EPOX on ERK, which increases the phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at T(163.) Overexpression of mitogen-activated protein/ERK kinase (MEK) partially reversed the effect of EPOX on Mcl-1 dephosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, further implicating ERK in the regulation of Mcl-1 stability. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that EPOX induces glutathione depletion, ERK inactivation, and Mcl-1 degradation on endothelial cells, which leads to inhibition of angiogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: through, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inactivation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: therapy, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: controlling, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: controlling, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: mechanism, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: targeting, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: endothelial signaling pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: apoptosis, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: association, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: Down-regulation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: resulted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: free, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: depletion, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inactivation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: treated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: supplementation, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: reversed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibitory effects, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: phosphorylation, Event Type: Phosphorylation;\nTrigger: Overexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: reversed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reversed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reversed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: dephosphorylation, Event Type: Dephosphorylation;\nTrigger: ubiquitination, Event Type: Ubiquitination;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: depletion, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inactivation, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: degradation, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: leads, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: leads, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: leads, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

The procedure is based on the use of a central skeleton of uteroglobin, a small and very soluble covalently linked homodimeric protein that is very resistant to proteolytic enzymes and to pH variations. Using a human recombinant antibody (scFv) specific for the angiogenesis marker domain B of fibronectin, interleukin 2, and an scFv able to neutralize tumor necrosis factor-alpha, we expressed various biologically active uteroglobin fusion proteins. The results demonstrate the possibility to generate monospecific divalent and tetravalent antibodies, immunocytokines, and dual specificity tetravalent antibodies. Furthermore, compared with similar fusion proteins in which uteroglobin was not used, the use of uteroglobin improved properties of solubility and stability.

METHODS: Thirty-six New Zealand white rabbits were evaluated in this study. A portion of bilateral radial bones of a rabbit were removed as free bone grafts, whose periostea were peeled off. In test group, the external maxillary artery bundle was passed through the marrow cavity of the bone. In control group, there was no vascular bundle implantation. Each bone was placed in masseter muscle separately. The rabbits were sacrificed and the specimens were procured at 3 days, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 weeks after surgery for histological observation, Chinese ink perfusion and CD34 immunohistochemistry. Microvessel density (MVD) was assessed in order to evaluate angiogenesis of autogenous bone grafts. RESULTS: The bone grafts were found revascularization in 3 days after surgery in the test group, whereas at 2 weeks in the control group. In 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks and 4 weeks after surgery, the MVD of test group was significantly higher than that of control group. In 4 weeks after surgery, angiogenesis of test group reached to peak.

The special attention is focused on the ambiguity of the neutrophil role in oncogenesis. The dominant view is that neutrophils display exclusively antitumor properties. The update information testifies about protumoral activity of neutrophils: they migrate to a tumor and promote angiogenesis and metastasis at late stages of the tumor.

In a three-dimensional model of breast carcinogenesis, disorganized, proliferative transformed breast epithelial cells express significantly higher expression of angiogenic genes compared with their polarized, growth-arrested nonmalignant counterparts. Elevated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by malignant cells enhanced recruitment of endothelial cells (EC) in heterotypic cocultures. Significantly, phenotypic reversion of malignant cells via reexpression of HoxD10, which is lost in malignant progression, significantly attenuated VEGF expression in a hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha-independent fashion and reduced EC migration. This was due primarily to restoring polarity: forced proliferation of polarized, nonmalignant cells did not induce VEGF expression and EC recruitment, whereas disrupting the architecture of growth-arrested, reverted cells did. These data show that disrupting cytostructure activates the angiogenic switch even in the absence of proliferation and/or hypoxia and restoring organization of malignant clusters reduces VEGF expression and EC activation to levels found in quiescent nonmalignant epithelium. These data confirm the importance of tissue architecture and polarity in malignant progression.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Recruiting, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: transformed, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: Elevated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: enhanced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: recruitment, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: phenotypic reversion, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: reexpression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: attenuated, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: independent, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: forced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induce, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: recruitment, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: disrupting, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: reduces, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduces, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development</s>"}

The aims of the present study were to compare, in vitro and in vivo, the antiangiogenic and antitumor activities of metronomic irinotecan (CPT-11), oxaliplatin (L-OHP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in colorectal cancer and to investigate the metronomic combination of these drugs. In vitro cell proliferation, combination studies and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion analyses were performed on endothelial (HMVEC-d) and colorectal cancer (HT-29) cells exposed for 144 h to metronomic concentrations of SN-38, the active metabolite of CPT-11, L-OHP and 5-FU. HT-29 human colorectal cancer xenograft model was used and tumour growth, microvessel density and VEGF quantification were performed in tumours after the administration of metronomic CPT-11, L-OHP, 5-FU and their simultaneous combination. Low concentrations of SN-38, but not 5-FU and L-OHP, preferentially inhibited endothelial cell proliferation. Simultaneous and continuous exposure of HT-29 and HMVEC-d cells to low concentrations SN-38+L-OHP+5-FU for 144 h showed a strong antagonism and an unfavorable dose-reduction index. Moreover, the ternary combination resulted in a significant increase of VEGF secretion in HT-29 cancer cells. In a xenograft model metronomic CPT-11, but not 5-FU and L-OHP, significantly inhibits HT-29 tumor growth and microvessel density in the absence of toxicity.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: enhances, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activities, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: activities, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: increase, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: secretion, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: tumor growth, Event Type: Growth</s>"}

Here we investigated the effects of small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) designed to disrupt integrin alpha2 I or beta1 I-like domain function on angiogenesis. In unchallenged endothelial cells, fibrillar collagen induced robust capillary morphogenesis. In contrast, tube formation was significantly reduced by SMI496, a beta1 I-like domain inhibitor and by function-blocking anti-alpha2beta1 but not -alpha1beta1 antibodies. Endothelial cells bound fluorescein-labeled collagen I fibrils, an interaction specifically inhibited by SMI496. Moreover, SMI496 caused cell retraction and cytoskeletal collapse of endothelial cells as well as delayed endothelial cell wound healing. SMI activities were examined in vivo by supplementing the growth medium of zebrafish embryos expressing green fluorescent protein under the control of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 promoter. SMI496, but not a control compound, interfered with angiogenesis in vivo by reversibly inhibiting sprouting from the axial vessels. We further characterized zebrafish alpha2 integrin and discovered that this integrin is highly conserved, especially the I domain. Notably, a similar vascular phenotype was induced by morpholino-mediated knockdown of the integrin alpha2 subunit. By live videomicroscopy, we confirmed that the vessels were largely nonfunctional in the absence of alpha2beta1 integrin. Collectively, our results provide strong biochemical and genetic evidence of a central role for alpha2beta1 integrin in experimental and developmental angiogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: plays a key role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: unchallenged, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: morphogenesis, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: bound, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: labeled, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: caused, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: cytoskeletal collapse, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: delayed, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: expressing, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: control, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: interfered, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibiting, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: sprouting, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: knockdown, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: central role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

An emerging area of research suggests that CSC may also support tumor progression by promoting tumor angiogenesis. To investigate how CSC contribute to tumor vascular development, we used an approach comparing tumor xenografts of the C6 glioma cell line containing either a low or a high fraction of CSC. Compared with CSC-low tumors, CSC-high tumors exhibited increased microvessel density and blood perfusion and induced increased mobilization and tumor recruitment of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC). CSC-high C6 cell cultures also induced higher levels of endothelial cell proliferation and tubule organization in vitro compared with CSC-low cultures. CSC-high cultures and tumors expressed increased levels of the proangiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and stromal-derived factor 1, and when signaling by either factor was blocked, all aspects of angiogenesis observed in CSC-high cultures and tumors, including microvessel density, perfusion, EPC mobilization/recruitment, and stimulation of endothelial cell activity, were reduced to levels comparable with those observed in CSC-low cultures/tumors. These results suggest that CSC contribute to tumor angiogenesis by promoting both local endothelial cell activity and systemic angiogenic processes involving bone marrow-derived EPC in a vascular endothelial growth factor-dependent and stromal-derived factor 1-dependent manner.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: vasculogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: proliferative, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: support, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: promoting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: contribute, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: mobilization, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: recruitment, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: proliferation, Event Type: Cell_proliferation;\nTrigger: organization, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: mobilization/recruitment, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: reduced, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: contribute, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: contribute, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: promoting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promoting, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation</s>"}

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent and a specific regulator of angiogenesis which principally targets endothelial cells and regulates several of their functions, including mitogenesis, permeability and migration. The impact of elevated VEGF expression on the course of chronic myeloid leukaemia is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the follow-up of VEGF expression during the course of CML. METHODS: We studied VEGF expression of 85 CML patients (median age 50 years, range 16-75 years). At the commencement of the study, 29 patients were in chronic phase (CP), 25 in an accelerated phase (AP), and 31 in the blast crisis (BC). The temporal expression (percentage positivity per 1000 analysed cells) VEGF proteins over the course of CML were studied using the immunohistochemical technique utilizing relevant monoclonal antibodies. It was correlated with the laboratory (Hb, WBC and platelet counts, and the percentage of blasts) and clinical parameters (organomegaly, duration of CP, AP, and BC) of disease progression. RESULTS: The expression ofVEGF protein was most pronounced in AP (ANOVA, p=0.033). The level of VEGF expression correlated inversely with the degree of splenomegaly (Pearson, r=-0.400, p=0.011).

NO is synthesized through three isoforms of NO synthase (NOS). It is hypothesized that the NO derived from inducible NOS (iNOS) may promote survival of ischemic tissue through angiogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of iNOS deficiency (by L-NIL) on angiogenesis in a hindlimb ischemia model. METHODS: Thirty-two male wistar rats randomly divided into four groups. In groups 1 & 2, hindlimb ischemia was induced by ligation of femoral artery and they received L-NIL and saline respectively. The animals in groups 3 and 4 also received L-NIL and saline respectively without surgical procedure. After 21 days, the serum concentration of nitrite, capillary density and expression of HIF1alpha were determined. RESULTS: Serum nitrite levels were significantly lower in L-NIL groups (p<0.05). The capillary density in group 1 (ischemia+L-NIL) was significantly different from group 2 (ischemia+saline); group 1: 360.33+/-77.02, group 2: 549+/-81.85 /mm2, p<0.05) .In addition, expression of HIF1alpha was significantly increased in ischemic groups (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: Selective inhibition of iNOS by L-NIL inhibits angiogenesis in a hindlimb ischemic rat model. In addition, ischemia induces expression of HIF1alpha in hypoxic tissue.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: modulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: plays an important role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: maintaining, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: delivery, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: synthesized, Event Type: Synthesis;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promote, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: survival, Event Type: Death;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: ligation, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induces, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression</s>"}

In particular, the activity of angiogenic factors is crucial for tumor progression. We previously characterized a secreted fibroblast growth factor-binding protein (FGF-BP) as a chaperone molecule, which binds to various FGFs, enhances FGF-mediated biochemical and biologic events and importantly is a crucial rate-limiting factor for tumor-dependent angiogenesis. We generated monoclonal antibodies that target FGF-BP protein and used them as a tool to evaluate frequency and pattern of FGF-BP expression during the malignant progression of pancreas and colorectal carcinoma in archival tissue samples. We found that FGF-BP is dramatically upregulated during the initiation of colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Crucial genetic events underlying the initiation and progression of colorectal and pancreatic adenocarcinoma with a particular focus on the modulation of angiogenesis and antiangiogenic therapies are discussed. We propose that the upregulation of the secreted FGF-BP protein during early phases of pancreas and colon cancer could make this protein a possible serum marker indicating the presence of high-risk premalignant lesions. Furthermore, the biological activity of FGF-BP is neutralized by monoclonal antibodies suggesting the potential for antibody-based therapeutic targeting.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Therapeutic Targeting, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: Angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: secreted, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: various, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: crucial, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: generated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: upregulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: progression, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: modulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: therapies, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: upregulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: secreted, Event Type: Localization</s>"}

The most intense immunoreactivity was observed in branching capillaries. Endothelial cell staining was heterogeneous and varied in different regions. Strong staining for bFGF was also found in cardiac muscle fibers, smooth muscle cells of mid-size blood vessels, the gut and the myometrium, in central nervous system neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells, and on epithelial cells of the bronchi, colon, endometrium, and sweat gland ducts of the skin.

To the authors' knowledge, there is no direct in vivo evidence in the human proving this theory. One hundred and twenty-two diabetic subjects were studied to see whether worsening retinopathy was associated with changes in conjunctival oxygen tension (pO2). Diabetics without retinopathy had a conjunctival pO2 which was similar to an age-matched normal population. Diabetics with only background retinopathy had a significantly lower conjunctival pO2 than those without retinopathy (P less than 0.01). Diabetics with proliferative retinopathy showed a conjunctival pO2 that was significantly lower than either of the first two groups (P less than 0.05). The lowest value of all was found in patients with rubeosis iridis. Duration of diabetes alone did not correlate significantly to conjunctival pO2.

Prior studies showed enhancement of such carcinogenesis by repeated 20 rad head and neck X-radiation exposures, and it was proposed that one possible mechanism was radiogenic alteration of the functional microvasculature in a manner which favored subsequent tumor development. Hamsters were treated with either radiation, DMBA, radiation + DMBA, or no treatment. Animals were sacrificed at 3-week intervals from 0 to 39 weeks after treatments began. Pouch vascular volume and permeability changes were studied by fractional distributions of radiotracers and were analyzed by a variety of statistical methods which explored the vascular parameters, treatment types, elapsed time, presence of the carcinogen, and histopathologic changes. All treatments resulted in significant changes in vascular volume with time, while only DMBA treatments alone resulted in significant changes in vascular permeability with time. Prior to the appearances of frank neoplasms, volumetric changes in DMBA only and radiation only groups were similar, while volume changes in DMBA + radiation groups increased slowly to a peak later than in other groups and then declined steadily to levels similar to the radiation only group. As in prior studies, there were significant vascular volume differences between DMBA and DMBA + radiation groups of tumor-bearing cheek pouches.

It is also clear that diffusible angiogenic stimuli can be released not only from most solid tumors, but also from at least three non-neoplastic cells. These include activated macrophages, sensitized lymphocytes, and adipocytes. Other normal tissues can also stimulate angiogenesis, but the type of cell giving rise to the angiogenic stimulus is unknown, and the period of angiogenic stimulation is brief. With the recent ability to clone capillary endothelial cells and to carry them in long-term culture, it has been possible to further delineate the mechanism of capillary growth. In vitro studies have shown that the mast cell seems to behave as a helper cell for capillary endothelial cells, in some way speeding up their rate of directional migration. At this writing, heparin appears to be the principal mast cell factor responsible for this effect on capillary endothelial cells. One theoretical possibility is that mast cells may prepare the matrix, perhaps by slow release of heparin, so that capillary sprouts can more easily move through it toward their angiogenic target. While the study of angiogenesis as a phenomenon is still in an early phase, it has become possible, by using a combination of in vitro and in vivo techniques, to more thoroughly understand the initiation and control of capillary growth.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: control, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: lysis, Event Type: Breakdown;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: development, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: anastomosis, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: clone, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: culture, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: speeding up, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: effect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: prepare, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: move, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: control, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth</s>"}

Increased numbers of mast cells have been associated with several types of angiogenesis. We have used a quantitative assay in vitro to demonstrate that mast cells release a factor that significantly increases bovine capillary endothelial cell migration. The factor is present in medium conditioned by mast cells as well as lysates of mast cells. The stimulatory effect of mast cells on migration is specific for capillary endothelial cells. Furthermore, mast cells have no mitogenic activity for capillary endothelial cells. Of all the secretory products of mast cells tested, only heparin stimulated capillary endothelial cell migration in vitro. Heparin preparations from a variety of sources stimulated capillary endothelial cell migration to the same degree but did not stimulate migration of several other cell types. The migration activity of heparin and mast cell conditioned medium was blocked by specific antagonists of heparin (protamine and heparinase), but not by chondroitinase ABC. The migration activity of mast cell conditioned medium was resistant to heat (100 degrees C) and incubation with proteolytic enzymes. These results suggest that the role of mast cells in angiogenesis may be to enhance migration of the endothelial cells of growing capillaries.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: stimulates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: Migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: associated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: increases, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulatory effect, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: mitogenic activity, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: stimulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: enhance, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: growing, Event Type: Growth</s>"}

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and rat aorta smooth muscle cells (RASMCs) infected with AdCMV.VEGF165 (5 and 20 plaque-forming units [pfu] per cell) demonstrated VEGF mRNA expression and protein secretion into the supernatant. Furthermore, the conditioned medium from these cells enhanced vascular permeability in vivo. In contrast, neither VEGF mRNA nor secreted protein was found in uninfected HUVECs or RASMCs or in cells infected with the control vector AdCMV.beta gal (where beta gal is beta-galactosidase). Assessment of starved HUVECs at 14 days demonstrated sixfold more cells for AdCMV.VEGF165-infected HUVECs (20 pfu per cell) than for either infected or uninfected control cells. RASMC proliferation was unaffected by infection with AdCMV.VEGF165.

In the present study, a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis was synthesized by covalently linking a nonanticoagulating derivative of heparin, heparin adipic hydrazide (HAH), by an acid-labile bond to the antiangiogenic steroid, cortisol. The rationale was that the heparin derivative, which binds to sulfated polyanion receptors on endothelial cells, should concentrate the steroid on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. Endocytosis of the conjugate and decomposition of the acid-labile linkage inside lysosomes and other acidic intracellular compartments should then lead to release of the cortisol and expression of its antiproliferative activity. Analysis of the stability of HAH-cortisol showed that it was stable at pH 7.4 and broke down rapidly (t1/2 15 min) at pH 4.8 at 37 degrees C. Treatment of murine pulmonary capillary endothelial cells with HAH-cortisol at 10(-5) M (with respect to cortisol) suppressed their DNA synthesis by 50% and inhibited their migration into wounded areas of confluent monolayers. HAH-cortisol at 10(-4) M (with respect to cortisol) did not suppress the DNA synthesis of Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Daily i.p. injections of HAH-cortisol into mice bearing s.c. sponge implants retarded vascularization of the sponge, and injections directly into the sponge abolished vascularization for as long as the injections were continued. Daily i.v. injections of HAH-cortisol at doses causing no apparent toxicity retarded the growth of solid s.c. Lewis lung carcinomas in mice by up to 65%. In all of these assays, equivalent treatments with a mixture of the HAH plus cortisol was significantly less effective.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: activity, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: binds, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: broke down, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: Treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: injections, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: retarded, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: abolished, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: vascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: injections, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: retarded, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: treatments, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

Several enzyme systems have been implicated in the metastatic process, but the metalloproteinases (MPs) appear to be the major group involved in most instances of neoplastic invasion. Increased MP activity has been correlated with the metastatic potential of many cancers, including breast cancer. MPs also play a role in tumor angiogenesis. Tetracyclines are antimicrobial agents that can suppress MP activity in a variety of tissues, including gingiva, bone, and cartilage. Several reports have indicated that tetracyclines can suppress tumor MPs as well. A synthetic tetracycline, doxycycline, inhibits migration of human MDA-MB-435 breast adenocarcinoma cells through a reconstituted basement membrane (Matrigel), an assay used as an in vitro surrogate for the in vivo process of tumor invasion through basement membranes.

Vascular and neoplastic tissue from 14 colonic adenocarcinomas, 13 carcinoids, 6 renal-cell carcinomas and 7 malignant lymphomas were analyzed for somatostatin receptors by use of quantitative receptor autoradiography. In colonic carcinoma specimens, the peritumoral vessels expressed a high density of somatostatin receptors, whereas the neoplastic tissue itself was receptor-negative in many cases. In contrast, the incidence and density of somatostatin receptors in peritumoral vessels was low in well-differentiated gastrointestinal and bronchial carcinoids, in contrast to the high density of such receptors in the carcinoid tumor tissue. Autochthonous vessels surrounding other tumors such as renal-cell carcinomas or malignant lymphomas also frequently expressed somatostatin receptors. In all cases, the somatostatin receptors were localized in veins, particularly in the smooth-muscle cell layer. They exhibited specific and high-affinity binding of somatostatin-14, somatostatin-28 and octreotide, suggesting a preferential expression of the SSTR2 receptor subtype. Since the vessels of normal non-neoplastic human tissues, e.g. of intestine or lymphatic organs, have few somatostatin receptors, the increased somatostatin receptor expression in peritumoral vessels observed in this study may be linked to the neoplastic process itself. The results suggest that somatostatin and somatostatin receptors may play a regulatory role for hemodynamic tumor-host interactions, possibly involving tumor stroma generation, tumor environment, angiogenesis and, particularly, vascular drainage of poorly differentiated neoplasms.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: interaction, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: detected, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: negative, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: differentiated, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: differentiated, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: localized, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: binding, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: play a regulatory role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: play a regulatory role, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: interactions, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: involving, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involving, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involving, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: involving, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: generation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: differentiated, Event Type: Development</s>"}

At the cellular level, the result is hypoxia which impairs wound healing. Hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) may be a useful adjuvant to wound care. It leads to enhanced oxygenation of the affected tissues, has an antiseptic effect, reduces edema, and accelerates collagen production and angiogenesis, thus enhancing tissue repair. 14 diabetics with chronic nonhealing wounds which did not respond to treatment for at least 3 months were treated by HBO. All had palpable pedal pulses. Transcutaneous measurements of tissue pO2 showed elevation from 20 +/- 10 mm Hg during air breathing to 643 +/- 242 mm Hg while breathing pure oxygen at 2.5 ATA. They were treated with HBO in 56 +/- 10 consecutive HBO sessions. In 11 there was complete wound healing, while in 1 there was partial response, in 1 minimal response, and in 1 a transient response. HBO is useful in chronic nonhealing wounds of the diabetic foot and of the diabetic foot with impending amputation. It is a safe mode of therapy, but further studies are required to establish its efficacy and to ascertain which diabetic patients and wounds will benefit the most from it.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Treatment, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: reduces, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: accelerates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: accelerates, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: production, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: enhancing, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: repair, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: amputation, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

A vascular prosthesis needs angiogenesis for endothelialization of the luminal surface, as endothelial cells have natural and permanent antithrombogenic properties. To induce capillary growth into the graft, we developed a method of transplanting bone marrow cells, which are primitive, strong enough to survive, and create blood cells, resulting in the inducement of capillary growth. In an animal experiment, marrow cells were infiltrated into the walls of long-fibril expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) vascular grafts. The grafts were implanted in the abdominal aortic position of 24 dogs autologously. Marrow cells survived and continued exogenous hemopoiesis for up to six months and were immunohistochemically reactive to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). All the grafts older than three weeks had complete endothelialization and maintained their patency. Twenty grafts without bone marrow were implanted as controls. Endothelialization was present at anastomotic sites, but other areas were covered with fresh thrombi. Four out of seven control grafts were patent with endothelial cell lining at six months, but three were occluded and one of the four grafts was still covered with a thrombus layer.

We have examined this hypothesis using a model that measures the neovascularization of an implanted foreign material. Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sheets were implanted adjacent to both superficial epigastric vascular pedicles of 63 rats distributed into 7 groups (n = 7) that differed with respect to dose and timing of irradiation. Zero to 10 daily fractions of electron-beam radiation (300 cGy each) were delivered to the implant in the right groin, while the implant in the left groin served as a nonirradiated internal control. Unirradiated animals showed equal neovascularization of both implants. Rats that were irradiated twice (single fractions at 0 and 24 hours after implantation) did not show a significant decrease in the neovascularization of the irradiated implant compared with the contralateral control implant. In contrast, the implants that were irradiated three times (single fractions at 0, 24, and 48 hours after implantation) demonstrated significantly diminished (  greater than  25 percent, p  less than  0.05) neovascularization beyond day 7, whereas implants irradiated only at 48 hours after implantation did not. Interestingly, neovascularization of the implants irradiated with 10 fractions (3000 cGy) was not significantly decreased compared with irradiation with three fractions (900 cGy). Irradiation delivered before implantation (900 cGy) inhibited neovascularization significantly less than the same dose administered after implantation. The results of this study suggest that a subclinical cumulative dose of 900 cGy is the threshold for impaired tissue revascularization provided that treatment is delivered immediately after implantation over a 48-hour interval.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: effects, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: inhibits, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: implanted, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: irradiated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: decrease, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: diminished, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: decreased, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: inhibited, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: impaired, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: revascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

VPF/VEGF induced dermal microvascular EC expression of mRNAs encoding the alphav and beta3 integrin subunits resulting in increased levels of the alphavbeta3 heterodimer at the cell surface, and VPF/VEGF also induced mRNA encoding osteopontin (OPN), an alphavbeta3 ligand. OPN promoted EC migration in vitro; and VPF/VEGF induction of alphavbeta3 was accompanied by increased EC migration toward OPN. Because thrombin cleavage of OPN results in substantial enhancement of OPN's adhesive properties, and because VPF/VEGF promotes increased microvascular permeability leading to activation of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, we also investigated whether VPF/VEGF facilitates thrombin cleavage of OPN in vivo. Consistent with this hypothesis, co-injection of VPF/VEGF together with OPN resulted in rapid cleavage of OPN by endogenous thrombin. Furthermore, in comparison with native OPN, thrombin-cleaved OPN stimulated a greater rate of EC migration in vitro, which was additive to the increased migration associated with induction of alpha v beta 3. Thus, these data demonstrate cooperative mechanisms for VPF/VEGF regulation of EC migration involving the alphavbeta3 integrin, the alphavbeta3 ligand OPN, and thrombin cleavage of OPN. These findings also illustrate an operational link between VPF/VEGF induction of EC gene expression and VPF/VEGF enhancement of microvascular permeability, suggesting that these distinct biological activities may act accordingly to stimulate EC migration during angiogenesis.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Stimulation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenic, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: regulates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Transcription;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promoted, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhancement, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: extrinsic coagulation pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: facilitates, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: co-injection, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: cleaved, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: cleaved, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: regulation, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Catabolism;\nTrigger: cleavage, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: enhancement, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: stimulate, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

Although some recent reports suggest that microvessel counts in non-small cell lung cancer are related to a poor disease outcome, the results were not conclusive and were not compared with other molecular prognostic markers. In the present study, the vascular grade was assessed in 107 (T1,2-N0,1) operable non-small cell lung carcinomas, using the JC70 monoclonal antibody to CD31. Three vascular grades were defined with appraisal by eye and by Chalkley counting: high (Chalkley score 7-12), medium (5-6), and low (2-4). There was a significant correlation between eye appraisal and Chalkley counting (P  less than  0.0001). Vascular grade was not related to histology, grade, proliferation index (Ki67), or EGFR or p53 expression. Tumours from younger patients had a higher grade of angiogenesis (P = 0.05). Apart from the vascular grade, none of the other factors examined was statistically related to lymph node metastasis (P  less than  0.0001). A univariate analysis of survival showed that vascular grade was the most significant prognostic factor (P = 0.0004), followed by N-stage (P = 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, N-stage and vascular grade were not found to be independent prognostic factors, since they were strongly related to each other. Excluding N-stage, vascular grade was the only independent prognostic factor (P = 0.007). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a statistically significant worse prognosis for patients with high vascular grade, but no difference was observed between low and medium vascular grade. These data suggest that angiogenesis in operable non-small cell lung cancer is a major prognostic factor for survival and, among the parameters tested, is the only factor related to cancer cell migration to lymph nodes. The integration of vascular grading in clinical trials on adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy could substantially contribute in defining groups of operable patients who might benefit from cytotoxic treatment.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: metastasis, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: chemotherapy, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: radiotherapy, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

We investigated the hypothesis that naked DNA encoding for VEGF could be used in a strategy of arterial gene therapy to stimulate collateral artery development. Plasmid DNA encoding each of the three principal human VEGF isoforms (phVEGF121, phVEGF165, or phVEGF189) was applied to the hydrogel polymer coating of an angioplasty balloon and delivered percutaneously to one iliac artery of rabbits with operatively induced hindlimb ischemia. Compared with control animals transfected with LacZ, site-specific transfection of phVEGF resulted in augmented collateral vessel development documented by serial angiography, and improvement in calf blood pressure ratio (ischemic to normal limb), resting and maximum blood flow, and capillary to myocyte ratio. Similar results were obtained with phVEGF121, phVEGF165, and phVEGF189, which suggests that these isoforms are biologically equivalent with respect to in vivo angiogenesis. The fact that viral or other adjunctive vectors were not required further suggests that secreted gene products may have potential therapeutic utility even when the number of successfully transfected cells remains low.

Integrins and growth factors are capable of activating the ras/MAP kinase pathway in vitro, yet how these signals influence endothelial cells during angiogenesis is unknown. Upon initiation of angiogenesis with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) on the chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), endothelial cell mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (ERK) activity was detected as early as 5 min yet was sustained for at least 20 h. The initial wave of ERK activity (5-120 min) was refractory to integrin antagonists, whereas the sustained activity (4-20 h) depended on integrin alphavbeta3, but not beta1 integrins. Inhibition of MAP kinase kinase (MEK) during this sustained alphavbeta3-dependent ERK signal blocked the formation of new blood vessels while not influencing preexisting blood vessels on the CAM. Inhibition of MEK also blocked growth factor induced migration but not adhesion of endothelial cells in vitro. Therefore, angiogenesis depends on sustained ERK activity regulated by the ligation state of both a growth factor receptor and integrin alphavbeta3.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: Angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: depends, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: activating, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: pathway, Event Type: Pathway;\nTrigger: influence, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: refractory, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: depended, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: depended, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: blocked, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: formation, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: influencing, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: Inhibition, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: adhesion, Event Type: Binding;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: depends, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: regulated, Event Type: Regulation</s>"}

Here, we investigated the expression of Ets-1 during reendothelialization. When a confluent monolayer of human umbilical vein endothelial cell line, ECV304, was denuded, ECV304 at the wound edge expressed Ets-1. An immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Ets-1 accumulated in migrating cells at the wound edge and returned to basal level when reendothelialization was accomplished. This induction of Ets-1 could be reproduced in in vivo denudation of rat aortic endothelium by a balloon catheter. The induction of Ets-1 in ECs after denudation was regulated transcriptionally, and humeral factors released from injured ECs might not be responsible. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activities were investigated to explore the mechanism of this induction. Although extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1), and p38 were activated after denudation, the activation of ERK1 and p38 was more rapid and prominent. PD98059, a specific MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) 1 inhibitor, did not affect the induction of ets-1 mRNA, whereas SB203580, a specific p38 inhibitor, almost completely abrogated its induction. These results indicate that Ets-1 is induced in ECs after denudation through activation of p38. This induction of Ets-1 may be relevant for reendothelialization by regulating the expression of certain genes.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reendothelialization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: expression, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: reendothelialization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: denuded, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: denuded, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: accumulated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reendothelialization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reproduced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: denudation, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: denudation, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: regulated, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activated, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: affect, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: abrogated, Event Type: Negative_regulation;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: denudation, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: induction, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reendothelialization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development</s>"}

In 17 rabbits, a 2-cm strip of latissimus dorsi was woven into the parascapular fat pad on one side, with the contralateral fat pad serving as a control. At 3 weeks, the endogenous blood supply of both the control and the experimental fat pads was isolated and ligated, and the composite fat/muscle flap was transferred to the chest wall. At 6 weeks, animals were killed, and flaps were analyzed for length, width, and weight; perfused with fluorescein or lead oxide; and examined histologically. Significant differences were found between the control and experimental fat pads with regard to weight and length. Experimental flaps were found to be perfused fully with fluorescein and lead oxide; control fat pads were found not to be perfused. The lead oxide group revealed extensive growth of blood vessels from the latissimus graft into the experimental fat pad. No vessels were visualized in the controls. Finally, sections of the control and experimental flaps were analyzed histologically. A preponderance of viable fat, with evidence of neovascularization, was found in experimental flaps, compared with the necrotic fat that characterized the controls. We conclude that prefabrication of a fat flap is possible and may have extensive application in various areas of plastic surgery.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: prefabricated, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: woven, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: woven, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: transferred, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: perfused, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: perfused, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: perfused, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: perfused, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: perfused, Event Type: Planned_process;\nTrigger: growth, Event Type: Growth;\nTrigger: neovascularization, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: prefabrication, Event Type: Planned_process</s>"}

The mode of Ca2+ entry regulating cell shape is unknown. We hypothesized that activation of store-operated Ca2+ channels (SOCs) is sufficient to promote cell shape change necessary for these processes. SOC activation in rat pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased free cytosolic Ca2+ that was dependent on a membrane current having a net inward component of 5.45 +/- 0.90 pA/pF at -80 mV. Changes in endothelial cell shape accompanied SOC activation and were dependent on Ca2+ entry-induced reconfiguration of peripheral (cortical) filamentous actin (F-actin). Because the identity of pulmonary endothelial SOCs is unknown, but mammalian homologues of the Drosophila melanogaster transient receptor potential (trp) gene have been proposed to form Ca2+ entry channels in nonexcitable cells, we performed RT-PCR using Trp oligonucleotide primers in both rat and human pulmonary arterial endothelial cells. Both cell types were found to express Trp1, but neither expressed Trp3 nor Trp6. Our study indicates that 1) Ca2+ entry in pulmonary endothelial cells through SOCs produces cell shape change that is dependent on site-specific rearrangement of the microfilamentous cytoskeleton and 2) Trp1 may be a component of pulmonary endothelial SOCs.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: entry, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: promotes, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: shape change, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: expressing, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: Activation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: entry, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: produce, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: produce, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: produce, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: shape change, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: migration, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: initiation, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: angiogenesis, Event Type: Blood_vessel_development;\nTrigger: entry, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: shape change, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: increased, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: Changes, Event Type: Development;\nTrigger: dependent, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: entry, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: induced, Event Type: Positive_regulation;\nTrigger: reconfiguration, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: entry, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: express, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: expressed, Event Type: Gene_expression;\nTrigger: entry, Event Type: Localization;\nTrigger: produces, Event Type: Regulation;\nTrigger: shape change, Event Type: Development</s>"}
