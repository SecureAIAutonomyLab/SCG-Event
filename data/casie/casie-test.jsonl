The organization sent the letter Tuesday to about 2,800 members who may have been affected by the data breach. Christina Salcido, vice president of mission operations, said members\u2019 names, birth dates, home addresses, insurance policy numbers and health history information could have been accessed from Sept 30 to Oct 1. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we are notifying everyone whose email was in this email account,\u201d Salcido wrote in the letter. On the day the organization became aware of the breach, IT services changed the password and determined it was secure, Salcido wrote. The Girl Scouts of Orange County reviewed the account, eliminated all personal information it contained and notified the California attorney general\u2019s office of the breach. Because the email account was used for the organization\u2019s travel purposes, it contained information about members dating to 2014. Salcido said the third party used the account to send messages, but she did not specify what type of messages were sent. Elizabeth Fairchild, spokeswoman for the Girl Scouts of Orange County, said staff members noticed Oct 1 that the email account had been used the day before \u201cto send out non-Girl Scout related emails.\u201d On Oct 1, staff members sent an email to members telling them what happened, stating they had secured the account and advising them to not open any unusual emails from that account. \u201cThe vast majority of information stored in the account was nonsensitive,\u201d Fairchild said. \u201cFewer than 300 had sensitive information stored in the account.\u201d The Girl Scouts of Orange County provided contact information for the credit bureaus Equifax, Experian and TransUnion and suggested that members place fraud alerts on their accounts.

Ransomware is a type of computer malware that scrambles data and demands a fee for it to be restored. Citizens have been told they must visit government offices to do tasks usually completed online or by phone. The county commissioner told local media that he was taking advice from cybersecurity experts and the FBI. Licking County, which is in Ohio, has about 170,000 residents. The local government says it has about 1,000 computers and 12 servers, which have been taken offline making many government websites inaccessible. Many of the county's public services, including the emergency services, have resorted to working in \"manual mode\" without their computers, to prevent the malware being spread to more devices. Residents are still able to call 911 in an emergency but the process may take longer than usual. \"It's slower than we'd like,\" Sean Grady, director of the Licking County Emergency Management Agency, told the Newark Advocate. \"It takes us back 25 years in how we dispatch. We ask more detailed questions.\" County commissioner Tim Bubb said the malware was a \"crime against the people of Licking County\" but added that the government had not been specifically targeted. \"Clearly, it's designed to make money for somebody. It was just our unlucky day,\" he said. Some variants of ransomware have previously been defeated, with removal instructions now available online. However, security experts warn that in some cases the only way to get data back is by restoring from a back-up.

The scammers abused the handling of pop-ups in Mobile Safari in such a way that a person would be \u201clocked\u201d out from using Safari unless they paid a fee \u2014 or knew they could simply clear Safari\u2019s cache (see next section). The attack was contained within the app sandbox of the Safari browser; no exploit code was used in this campaign, unlike an advanced attack like Pegasus that breaks out of the app sandbox to install malware on the device.     The scammers registered domains and launched the attack from the domains they owned, such as police-pay[.]com, which the attackers apparently named with the intent of scaring users looking for certain types of material on the Internet into paying money. The pop-ups claimed to be from law-enforcement personnel, and claimed the only way to get control of the browser back was to pay a fine in the form of an iTunes gift card code delivered via text message. Users actually could have gotten out of the pop-up loop by manually clearing the Safari browser cache.

The Intercontinental Hotels Group data breach involved malware that had been downloaded onto its systems, which was capable of monitoring payment card systems and exfiltrating payment card data. It does not appear that any other information other than card details and cardholders\u2019 names were stolen by the attackers.

The Jigsaw Ransomware, named after the iconic character that appears in the ransom note, will delete files every hour and each time the infection starts until you pay the ransom.  At this time is currently unknown how this ransomware is distributed. This is the first time that we have seen these types of threats actually being carried out by a ransomware infection. The good news is that a method has been discovered that allows victims to decrypt their files for free. Jigsaw Ransomware is serious about its threats... It is not the first time that we have seen ransomware threaten to delete files, but this is the first time that one has actually carried out its threats.  The Jigsaw Ransomware deletes files every 60 minutes and when the program is restarted. Every hour,  the Jigsaw Ransomware will delete a file on your computer and increment a counter. Over time this counter will cause more than one file to be deleted every hour. More destructive, though, is the amount of files that are deleted every time the ransomware starts. After the initial infection, when the ransomware it restarted, whether that be from a reboot or terminating the process, Jigsaw will delete a thousand, yes a thousand, files from the victim's computer. This process is very destructive and obviously being used to pressure the victim into paying the ransom.

There is also a wide range of ransom prices being offered, with prices ranging from $20 to 200 USD.  Are these people motivated by money or is this just one big game to them?

Malware experts from antivirus vendor ESET have discovered a new file-encrypting ransomware, dubbed OSX/Filecoder.E, targeting MacOS that is being distributed through bittorrent websites.\u201cEarly last week, we have seen a new ransomware campaign for Mac. This new ransomware, written in Swift, is distributed via BitTorrent distribution sites and calls itself \u201cPatcher\u201d, ostensibly an application for pirating popular software.\u201d reads the analysis published by ESET. The bad news for the victims is that they will not be able to recover their files, even if they pay the ransom. MacOS ransomware is not common in the threat landscape, this is the second such malware discovered by the security experts after the researchers spotted the Keranger threat in March 2016.

The fake cracking tool is being distributed as a bittorrent download. The malware researchers noted that the ransomware is written in Apple\u2019s Swift programming language and it appears to be the result of the work of a novice Vxer. The MacOS ransomware is hard to install on the last OS X and MacOS versions because the installer is not signed with a developer certificate issued by Apple. The OSX/Filecoder.E MacOS ransomware generates a single encryption key for all files and then stores the files in encrypted zip archives. Unfortunately, the malicious code is not able to send the encryption key to the C&C server before being destroyed, this makes impossible the file decryption. The experts highlighted that implementation of the encryption process is effective and makes impossible to crack it. \u201cThere is one big problem with this ransomware: it doesn\u2019t have any code to communicate with any C&C server.

{"text": "The average ransomware attack yielded $1,077 last year, new research shows, representing a 266 percent spike from a year earlier. The reason for the landmark year for hackers? Many ransomware victims readily pay the price. The number of attacks, varieties of distinct malware and money lost ballooned as ransomware became one of the top tactics of attackers, according to new research from the security firm Symantec. Some of the most high-profile ransomware incidents of the last year include San Francisco\u2019s Muni getting hit, Washington D.C.\u2019s police department being breached just before inauguration and a Los Angeles college paying a $28,000 ransom. Hoping to turn the tide against the billion-dollar ransomware industry, last year the FBI urged businesses to alert authorities and not pay up. Instead, most keep attacks a secret, paying off hackers 70 percent of the time. That behavior only increases the sweet spot for demands, as criminals seek the highest possible ransom while trying to avoid the attention of law enforcement. Economists say hackers who apply more sophisticated pricing techniques \u201ccould lead to dramatic increases in profits at relatively little costs.\u201d The highest demand seen in public during the last was $28,730 from MIRCOP ransomware. It\u2019s not clear if anyone actually paid off those specific hackers. In private, however, higher ransoms are finding success when hackers successfully target the right companies.

Now, Mr. Gren and the thousands of other victims worldwide face an agonizing choice: either hand over the ransom \u2014 a figure that has climbed to $600 for each affected machine \u2014 by a deadline this Friday, or potentially lose their digital information, including personal photos, hospital patient records and other priceless data, forever. \u201cI\u2019m pretty devastated,\u201d said Mr. Gren, 32, a manager of an online entertainment business in Krakow, Poland, who has spent almost all of his waking hours since Friday looking for ways to reclaim his digital data. \u201cI\u2019ve lost private files that I have no other way of recovering. For me, the damage has been huge.\u201d That decision has become even more difficult as cybersecurity experts and law enforcement officials have repeatedly warned people against paying the ransom ahead of this week\u2019s deadline. Aside from dissuading victims from handing over money that may help fund further such attacks, they caution that it is not guaranteed the attackers will return control of people\u2019s computers even if they pay the assailants in bitcoin, a digital currency favored in such ransomware attacks that can be difficult to trace. Officials also note that the attackers, who have yet to been named, have provided only three bitcoin addresses \u2014 similar to a traditional bank routing number \u2014 for all global victims to deposit the ransom, so it may prove difficult to know who has paid the digital fees. This haphazard planning has led many victims to hold off paying, at least until they can guarantee they will get their data back. So far, roughly $80,000 has been deposited into the bitcoin addresses linked to the attack, according to Elliptic, a company that tracks online financial transactions involving virtual currencies. F-Secure, a Finnish cybersecurity firm, has confirmed that some of the 200 individuals that it had identified, who had paid the ransom, had successfully had their files decrypted.", "events": [{"trigger": "ransomware attack", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "paying the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "handing over money", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "pay", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "ransomware attacks", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "deposit the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "has paid the digital fees", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "paying", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "has been deposited", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "the attack", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "had paid the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}]}

Palo Alto\u2019s Unit 42 threat research unit published a report last Friday showing how a string of connected attacks this year used decoy documents with official-looking government logos to lure unsuspecting users from targeted organizations to download infected documents and compromise their computer networks. Documents pretending to be from the U.S.National Security Agency, Iraqi intelligence, Russian security firm Kaspersky and the Kurdistan regional government were among those used to trick victims, Unit 42 said in a blog post (goo.gl/SvwrXv).  The Unit 42 researchers said the attacks had targeted organizations in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and Israel, as well as entities outside the Middle East in Georgia, India, Pakistan and the United States. The Saudi security agency said in its own statement that the attacks sought to steal data from computers using email phishing techniques targeting the credentials of specific users.

Modifications were made on March 10, according to the National Vulnerability Database. But two months later, hackers took advantage of the vulnerability to enter the credit reporting agency's systems: Equifax said the unauthorized access began in mid-May. Equifax did not respond to a question Wednesday about whether the patches were applied, and if not, why not. \"We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation and have shared indicators of compromise with law enforcement,\" it said.

The flaw affects the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) protocol, which is used in all instances of Windows\u2019 Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Remote Management (WinRM). The vulnerability, CVE-2018-0886, could allow remote code execution via a physical or wifi-based Man-in-the-Middle attack, where the attacker steals session data, including local user credentials, during the CredSSP authentication process.

But this week, researchers at Positive Technologies revealed a new security flaw in the subsystem that could let attackers compromise its MFS file system. Intel has released updates to address the problem, though, so Intel CPU owners should make sure their firmware is up-to-date. ME has become a repeated source of problems for Intel and its customers. The utility is a chip-on-a-chip that allows IT managers to remotely access company PCs with tools like Intel's Active Management Technology (AMT). ME has its own network interface, memory, operating system and file system (MFS) that are kept separate from the main system in a bid to prevent it from allowing hackers to access ostensibly secure information. The problem is that researchers have discovered numerous vulnerabilities in ME over the last few years; Positive Technologies revealed one in 2017 that allowed full takeover of ME via USB (it's since been fixed). Now, it's revealed another one that allows someone with physical access to a system to compromise ME and \"manipulate the state of MFS and extract important secrets\" with the ability to \"add files, delete files and change their protection attributes.\" Positive Technologies said the attack can be used to learn four keys MFS uses to secure data-- the Intel Integrity Key, Non-Intel Integrity Key, Intel Confidentiality Key and Non-Intel Confidentiality Key--that were supposed to be protected via a firmware update Intel released in 2017. Positive Technologies explained how someone with physical access to the system could bypass that patch to compromise those keys in its blog post: \"Positive Technologies expert Dmitry Sklyarov discovered vulnerability CVE-2018-3655, described in advisory Intel-SA-00125. He found that Non-Intel Keys are derived from two values: the SVN and the immutable non-Intel root secret, which is unique to each platform. By using an earlier vulnerability to enable the JTAG debugger, it was possible to obtain the latter value. Knowing the immutable root secret enables calculating the values of both Non-Intel Keys even in the newer firmware version. ...

{"text": "Tavis Ormandy, a Google Project Zero security researcher, has revealed details about a new major vulnerability discovered in Ghostscript, an interpreter for Adobe's PostScript and PDF page description languages. Ghostscript is by far the most widely used solution of its kind. The Ghostscript interpreter is embedded in hundreds of software suites and coding libraries that allow desktop software and web servers to handle PostScript and PDF-based documents.  Exploiting the bug Ormandy discovered requires that an attacker sends a malformed PostScript, PDF, EPS, or XPS file to a victim. Once the file reaches the Ghostscript interpreter, the malicious code contained within will execute an attacker's desired on that machine. The vulnerability, which has not received a CVE identifier just yet, allows an attacker to take over applications and servers that use vulnerable versions of Ghostscript. At the time of writing, there is no fix available. By far, the most affected projects are the ImageMagick image processing library, but also many Linux distros where this library ships by default. RedHat and Ubuntu have already confirmed they are affected, according to a CERT/CC security advisory released today. \"I *strongly* suggest that [Linux] distributions start disabling PS, EPS, PDF and XPS coders in [ImageMagick's] policy.xml by default,\" Ormandy said.  Because of Ghostscript's broad adoption in the web dev and software dev communities, Ormandy has had his eyes set on Ghostscript for the past few years.

{"text": "The two vulnerabilities are critical remote code execution flaws that exist in Adobe Photoshop CC. Adobe hurried out unscheduled patches today for two critical flaws that could enable remote code-execution in Photoshop CC. The patches impact two memory corruption vulnerabilities in Adobe Photoshop products, including Photoshop CC 2018 (v 19.1.6) and Photoshop CC 2017 (v 18.1.6), both for Windows and macOS. The release comes only a week after the company fixed a slew of glitches last Patch Tuesday. \u201cAdobe has released updates for Photoshop CC for Windows and macOS,\u201d the company said in a Wednesday security bulletin. \u201cThese updates resolve critical vulnerabilities in Photoshop CC 19.1.5 and earlier 19.x versions, as well as 18.1.5 and earlier 18.x versions.  Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code-execution in the context of the current user.\u201d Both vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-12810) and (CVE-2018-12811) are critical remote code-execution flaws, according to the advisory, but further details around both flaws are not available. Kushal Arvind Shah of Fortinet\u2019s FortiGuard Labs was credited with reporting the two flaws. Adobe said impacted users need to apply the fixes to the affected versions of Photoshop by updating to version 19.1.6 (via the applications\u2019 update mechanism). Last week, Adobe released 11 total fixes for an array of products, including two critical patches for Acrobat and Reader for Windows and macOS. Exploitation of those two vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. Adobe said in an email that it is not aware of any exploits in the wild for the flaws. The update is a priority 3 in severity, meaning that it resolves vulnerabilities in a product that has historically not been a target for attackers, according to the company\u2019s ranking system.

{"text": "The device manufacturer acquired St Jude Medical last year and has since been working to fix severe vulnerabilities found in its pacemakers. Abbott released its second and final round of planned cybersecurity updates to its pacemakers, programmers and remote monitoring systems to fix severe cybersecurity flaws in the devices. The patch will update the battery performance alert, allowing the device to monitor for abnormal battery behavior and automatically vibrate to tell the patient when something is wrong. The planned updates began last year, and the latest firmware update was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last week. The update applies to about 350,000 of Abbott\u2019s implantable cardioverter defibrillators and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators. The devices were originally manufactured by St Jude Medical, which Abbott acquired last year. At that time, St Jude was under fire for remaining quiet about defibrillator issues that caused rapid battery depletion. The FDA found St Jude continued to ship these devices despite knowing about the defect. In fact, the agency found those flaws caused patient deaths. The flaws, made public in 2016 by Muddy Waters and security firm MedSec, could allow an unauthorized user to access the defibrillaors and modify the programming controls. Since acquiring St Jude, Abbott has been working to patch those vulnerabilities. The FDA\u2019s recall notice said the firmware update will reduce the risk of patient harm due to premature battery depletion and potential exploitation of the flaws in the devices. The update will effectively complete the necessary patches to prevent unauthorized access.

Two of the vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-3259 and CVE-2018-3299) can be remotely exploited without authentication, while the third, CVE-2018-7489, would require the user to have a Rapid Home Provisioning account to execute and is considered by far the least severe of the three. Oracle noted that all three bugs only impact the server versions of Database, user clients are not considered to be vulnerable. For Fusion Middleware, the update will include a total of 56 CVE-listed flaws, including 12 that are remotely exploitable with CVSS base scores of 9.8, meaning an exploit would be fairly easy to pull off and offer near total control of the target machine. Of those 12, five were for critical flaws in WebLogic Server. Java SE will get 12 security fixes, with all but one being for remotely exploitable vulnerabilities in that platform. Oracle notes that though the CVSS scores for the flaws are fairly high, Solaris and Linux machines running software with lower user privileges will be considered to be at a lower risk than Windows environments that typically operate with admin privileges. MySQL was the target of 38 CVE-listed bug fixes this month, through just three of those are remotely exploitable.

Cisco has released patches for 34 vulnerabilities mostly affecting its IOS and IOS XE networking software, including three critical remote code execution security bugs. Perhaps the most serious issue Cisco has released a patch for is critical bug CVE-2018-0171 affecting Smart Install, a Cisco client for quickly deploying new switches for Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software. A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit a flaw in the client to reload an affected device and cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. Embedi, the security firm that found the flaw, initially believed it could only be exploited within an enterprise's network. However, it found millions of affected devices exposed on the internet. \"Because in a securely configured network, Smart Install technology participants should not be accessible through the internet. But scanning the internet has shown that this is not true,\" wrote Embedi. \"During a short scan of the internet, we detected 250,000 vulnerable devices and 8.5 million devices that have a vulnerable port open.\" Smart Install is supported by a broad range of Cisco routers and switches. The high number of devices with an open port is probably because the Smart Install client's port TCP 4786 is open by default. This situation is overlooked by network admins, Embedi said. The company has also published proof-of-concept exploit code, so it probably will be urgent for admins to patch. An attacker can exploit the bug by sending a crafted Smart Install message to these devices on TCP port 4786, according to Cisco. Embedi discovered the flaw last year, landing it an award at the GeekPwn conference in Hong Kong last May, and reported it to Cisco in September.

{"text": "A malicious website initially set up to extort visitors to pay a cryptocurrency ransom has changed its course. Instead of demanding payment via Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin in exchange for not leaking your password on the internet, the site now hijacks your computer\u2019s processing power to mine cryptocurrency in the background. Designed as a copy of the Have I Been Pwned attack, the site began by asking users to enter their emails to see if their password has been compromised. Unfortunately, if your password was breached, the site demanded a \u201cdonation\u201d of $10 by cryptocurrency to not publish your password in plain text on the web. Up to 1.4 billion passwords may have been breached, but it\u2019s unclear how accurate that figure is. However, because it may be easier \u2014 and safer \u2014 to change your password than pay the ransom, as The Next Web noted, the site shifted its focus from demanding ransomware payments to taking over your PC\u2019s processing power to mine for cryptocurrency in the background. The publication also confirmed that the malicious site did \u201chave a database with legitimate passwords,\u201d but that not all compromised passwords were stored in plain text. The Next Web did not reveal the site\u2019s address in its report, citing security reasons, but noted that it doesn\u2019t appear that any user had made payment. This is the latest ransomware in recent months that demand cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Prior to this incident, Thanatos encrypted files on a user\u2019s PC by hijacking it using a brute force method. If you want to regain access to those files, you had to send payment via cryptocurrency to get a key to decrypt your files. However, at the time, there didn\u2019t appear to be a proper decryption key even if you paid. According to a recent Google report, extortionists made out with $25 million in just two years, and cryptocurrency was the preferred way to get paid. Hackers are also changing the game when it comes to data theft. Rather than leaking the information to the dark markets, an IBM X-Force Intelligence Index report revealed that hackers prefer to hold files hostage in exchange for a ransom payment.", "events": [{"trigger": "extort", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "pay a cryptocurrency ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "demanding payment", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "has been compromised", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "was breached", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "demanded", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "may have been breached", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "pay the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "demanding ransomware payments", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "demand", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "this incident", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "had to send payment", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "get paid", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "data theft", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "leaking", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "a ransom payment", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}]}
{"text": "IBM\u2019s latest X-Force Threat Intelligence Index report reveals that more than 2.9 billion records were leaked through publicly disclosed incidents in 2017. While that sounds horribly bad, there\u2019s a bright side to this stormy disclosure: the number is 25 percent lower than the amount of records leaked in 2016. Why? Because hackers are shifting over to ransomware. They\u2019re becoming more focused on holding files hostage for money than on unleashing all that data to the dark markets.  According to IBM, this shift to ransomware cost corporations more than $8 billion globally during 2017, a number derived from downtime, ransom payments, and other impacts on day-to-day business. The global logistics and transportation industries alone lost \u201cmillions of dollars\u201d in revenue during 2017 due to ransomware attacks.  Ransomware is a type of malware that infiltrates a network and encrypts files on connected PCs. These files become unrecoverable, and require a \u201ckey\u201d generated by the hacker to be released from captivity. These keys are provided after a payment using cryptocurrency, adding to the overall cost corporations incur due to downtime. Hiring a third party to recover the files may or may not work, depending on the level of encryption.  \u201cWith the potentially irreversible encryption lock of crypto-ransomware, victims without up-to-date backups often choose to pay the ransom their attackers demand,\u201d the report states. \u201cLosing one\u2019s files on personal devices may cost a few hundred dollars, but that effect extends much further for organizations where infected users could cause the company to lose massive amounts of data, and possibly to have to pay the criminals considerable sums of money to get it back.\u201d  The report reveals that many organizations keep cryptocurrency on hand so they can resolve the problem quickly and reduce costly downtime. Law enforcement agencies discourage payments to hackers, but the rising ransomware \u201cepidemic\u201d is getting to the point where it may potentially cost corporations across the globe more than $11.5 billion annually by 2019, according to research by Cybersecurity Ventures.

{"text": "A flaw in certificate pinning exposed customers of a number of high-profile banks to man-in-the-middle attacks on both iOS and Android devices. A vulnerability in the mobile apps of major banks could have allowed attackers to steal customers' credentials including usernames, passwords, and pin codes, according to researchers.  The flaw was found in apps by HSBC, NatWest, Co-op, Santander, and Allied Irish bank. The banks in question have now all updated their apps to protect against the flaw. Uncovered by researchers in the Security and Privacy Group at the University of Birmingham, the vulnerability allows an attacker who is on the same network as the victim to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and steal information. The vulnerability lay in the certificate pinning technology, a security mechanism used to prevent impersonation attacks and use of fraudulent certificates by only accepting certificates signed by a single pinned CA root certificate. While certificate pinning usually improves security, a tool developed by the researchers to perform semi-automated security-testing of mobile apps found that a flaw in the technology meant standard tests failed to detect attackers trying to take control of a victim's online banking. As a result, certificate pinning can hide the lack of proper hostname verification, enabling man-in-the-middle attacks. The findings have been outlined in a research paper and presented at the Annual Computer Security Applications Conference in Orlando, Florida. The tool was run on 400 security critical apps in total, leading to the discovery of the flaw. Tests found apps from some of the largest banks contained the flaw which, if exploited, could have enabled attackers to decrypt, view, and even modify network traffic from users of the app. That could allow them to view information entered and perform any operation that app can usually perform -- such as making payments or transferring of funds. Other attacks allowed hackers to perform in-app phishing attacks against Santander and Allied Irish bank users, allowing attackers to take over part of the screen while the app was running and steal the entered credentials. The researchers have worked with the National Cyber Security Centre and all the banks involved to fix the vulnerabilities, noting that the current version of all the apps affected by the pinning vulnerability are now secure.", "events": [{"trigger": "steal", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "was found", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "updated", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "Uncovered", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "lay in", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "have been outlined", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "presented", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "the discovery", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "found", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "exploited", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "phishing attacks", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "steal", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "fix", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "affected", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}]}

The patch release impacts Adobe Flash, Acrobat and Reader, Experience Manager, and Creative Cloud. Two of the vulnerabilities disclosed in the release are described as critical and affect Acrobat and Reader. In July, Adobe issued a security update which patched a total of 112 vulnerabilities. The majority of bugs were uncovered in Adobe Acrobat, but a critical code execution flaw was also resolved in Adobe Flash. The critical bugs in this release impact Adobe Acrobat 2017, Acrobat DC, and Acrobat Reader DC on Windows and macOS machines. The tech giant says that exploitation of the security flaws, an out of bounds write issue (CVE-2018-12808) and an untrusted pointer dereference problem (CVE-2018-12799) can lead to arbitrary code execution. The vulnerabilities resolved include five bugs in Adobe Flash. An out of bounds read flaw (CVE-2018-12824), a security bypass error (CVE-2018-12825), two information disclosure vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-12826, CVE-2018-12827), and a privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2018-12828) have all been patched. A reflected cross-site scripting flaw (CVE-2018-12806), input validation bypass (CVE-2018-12807), and cross-site scripting (XSS) bug (CVE-2018-5005) have been patched in Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.0 -- 6.4 on all platforms. If exploited, the security flaws can facilitate sensitive information disclosure and data modification. In addition, a single bug in Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop affecting versions 4.5.0.324 and earlier versions on Windows systems has been resolved. The DLL hijacking vulnerability (CVE-2018-5003) can be exploited in order for an attacker to escalate privileges on an account.

The company also has fixes available for 11 more flaws outlined in 10 advisories with a medium-severity rating, most of which also address issues in IOS and IOS XE, the Linux-based train of Cisco's popular networking operating system. The updates for the 13 high-severity IOS and IOS XE flaws are part of Cisco's scheduled twice-yearly patch bundle for this software targeted for September. The company reported this week that some IOS XE releases were among 88 Cisco products vulnerable to the DoS attack on Linux systems known as FragmentSmack.  And earlier this month it plugged a critical hard-coded password bug in its video surveillance software. None of the flaws in the latest advisory is known to have been used in attacks and Cisco isn't aware of any public disclosures. Some of the higher severity flaws include a DoS flaw affecting the IOS XE Web UI, which could allow a remote attacker to trigger a reload of the device by sending special HTTP requests to the UI.

{"text": "Cisco has resolved a set of critical vulnerabilities in Policy Suite which permit attackers to cause havoc in the software's databases. This week, the tech giant released a security advisory detailing four vulnerabilities which could place enterprise users at risk of information leaks, account compromise, database tampering, and more. The first vulnerability, CVE-2018-0374, has earned a CVSS base score of 9.8. Described as an unauthenticated bypass bug, the security flaw \"could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect directly to the Policy Builder database,\" according to Cisco. The bug has been caused by a simple lack of authentication and as there is no requirement for identity verification, Policy Builder databases can be accessed and tampering with without limitation. Cisco Policy Suite releases prior to 18.2.0 are affected. The second vulnerability, CVE-2018-0375, is a default password error. The CVSS 9.8 bug is present in the Cluster Manager of Cisco Policy Suite and could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to log in to a vulnerable system using a root account. The serious security problem has emerged due to the use of undocumented, static user credentials for root accounts. If a hacker has knowledge of these credentials, they can become a root user and are able to execute arbitrary commands. Versions of the software prior to 18.2.0 are vulnerable to exploit. The third bug, CVE-2018-0376, is another unauthenticated access problem and is also caused by a lack of authentication measures. \"A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make changes to existing repositories and create new repositories,\" Cisco says. Cisco Policy Suite versions prior to 18.2.0 are affected. The fourth security flaw, CVE-2018-0377, affects the Open Systems Gateway initiative (OSGi) interface of Cisco Policy Suite. There is a lack of authentication within the OSGi interface which permits attackers to circumvent security processes and directly connect to the interface, access any files contained within they wish, and modify any content which is accessible through the process. This vulnerability impacts Policy Suite versions prior to 18.1.0. There are no workarounds to circumvent these vulnerabilities. However, patches have been issued to address them and Cisco says that no reports have been received which indicate the bugs are being exploited in the wild.", "events": [{"trigger": "has resolved", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "released", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "Described as", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "are affected", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "is present in", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "has emerged", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "are vulnerable", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "says", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "are affected", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "affects", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "impacts", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "have been issued to address", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "being exploited", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}]}

{"text": "Authorities on Wednesday charged two Iranian citizens for the ransomware cyber attack that hobbled the city of Atlanta\u2019s computer network in March, and the federal indictment outlines the pair\u2019s massive nationwide scheme to breach computer networks of local governments, health care systems and other public entities. The defendants, Faramarz Shahi Savandi, 34, and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri, 27, are alleged to have developed the SamSam ransomware, malicious software that encrypts data until the infected organizations paid ransom.  All told, the pair inflicted harm on more than 200 victims across the country and collected roughly $6 million in ransom over a three year period dating back to 2015. Their scheme caused over $30 million in losses to various entities, according to federal authorities. The hack to city of Atlanta computers in March crippled city business for days. One internal report that surfaced in August estimated the damage to the city could cost up to $17 million. \u201cWe\u2019re glad that these people will be brought to justice,\u201d Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told Channel 2 Action News. \u201cHopefully this will stop another municipality from experiencing what we did.\u201d \u201cThe defendants allegedly hijacked victims\u2019 computer systems and shut them down until the victims paid a ransom,\u201d said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, speaking at a press conference in Washington D.C. \u201cMany of the victims were public agencies with missions that involve saving lives and performing other critical functions for the American people.\u201d The two men are not in U.S. custody, and Iran has no extradition treaty with the U.S. But Justice Department officials expressed confidence that the Savandi and Mansouri\u2019s travel patterns would subject them to being captured. Atlanta officials have repeatedly denied paying the $51,000 in ransom demanded by the hackers and the 26-page federal indictment released Wednesday doesn\u2019t directly address which cities and entities paid ransom. Brian Benczkowski, an assistant attorney general for the U.S. Justice Department, told reporters on Wednesday that the agency wouldn\u2019t identify which victims paid the attackers.

{"text": "But the indictment has two references to Atlanta and it raises questions about whether or not the city paid ransom. The indictment describes the March 22 assault on Atlanta\u2019s network and the effort by the two men to demand ransom. In one paragraph, the indictment says they demanded ransom from Atlanta in Bitcoin payments in exchange for encryption keys to recover the city\u2019s compromised data. The next paragraph says that on April 19, Savandi \u201creceived funds associated with ransom proceeds, which were converted into Iranian rial and deposited by\u201d an currency exchanger. The indictment does not say if those proceeds were associated with the Atlanta attack. But Ralph Echemendia, a computer hacking consultant who advises corporations on cyber security, said he read the indictment and thinks the payment was associated with the Atlanta attack because it would be one way that federal agents connected the breach to Savanda and Mansouri. The indictment describes how the two men demanded payments in bitcoins, a so-called crypto currency, and in Atlanta\u2019s case, the demand equaled roughly $50,000. \u201cThe moment you try and turn it into dollars, euros or any kind of real currency it has to go through an exchange,\u201d Echemendia said. \u201cAt that point the exchange would have to work with law enforcement \u2026 ultimately that is going to wind up in somebody\u2019s back account.\u201d The Justice Department declined to answer a question from the AJC about whether April 19 exchange of bitcoins into Iranian rial described in the indictment was related to Atlanta\u2019s attack. Tony UcedaVelez, CEO of Versprite, an Atlanta based security services said the language in the indictment does make it seem a ransom was paid on the city\u2019s behalf. But he said it could have been made by someone in law enforcement hoping the funds would lead to the attackers. UcedaVelez also pointed to an attachment in the indictment that indicated someone associated with the city had followed the attackers\u2019 initial instructions.

But according to The Wall Street Journal, the company was hit with a strain known as SamSam. In March, the same strain attacked the city of Atlanta's IT network. Like other ransomware variants, SamSam will effectively lock down a computer, encrypting all the files inside, and then demand the victim pay up to free the system. In the Atlanta attack, the anonymous hackers demanded $51,000, which the city government reportedly refused to pay. How much the hackers are demanding from LabCorp isn't clear; the company declined to answer further questions about the attack or if it will pay the ransom. The lab testing provider first reported the breach on Monday, initially describing it as \"suspicious activity\" on the company's IT systems that relate to healthcare diagnostics.

{"text": "A phishing campaign is targeting customers of every major UK bank, with cybercriminals posing as customer support staff on Twitter in an attempt to steal users' online banking credentials. Easy to carry out but difficult to defend against, phishing is an increasingly popular weapon of choice for hackers. That's because, with an authentic-looking fake website, they can just sit back and scoop up data as victims unwittingly hand over their usernames and passwords. Phishing often relies on cybercriminals sending tailored emails to potential victims in an effort to lure them into giving up credentials or installing malware. However, cybersecurity researchers at Proofpoint have uncovered an Angler phishing campaign which, rather than being tailored to specific users, takes advantage of how they can often be careless on social media -- specifically Twitter. In this instance, cybercriminals monitor Twitter for users approaching genuine support accounts for banks, and attempt to hijack the conversation with a fake support page. This sort of phishing attack is unlikely to provide cybercriminals with the big score they'd hit if they targeted a corporate network, but it does enable the easy theft of credentials and small amounts of money -- and repeated success could become lucrative, and also provide criminals with access to other types of data which can be used to commit fraud. \"In many of the examples we've seen, the hacker is not just collecting banking credentials. They also look for information like ATM Pin, Credit/Debit card numbers, security questions and answers, and even social security numbers. With this information, they can circumvent some security measures, make purchases/withdrawals without online access, or create entirely new bogus accounts using the customer's information,\" says Celeste Kinswood at Proofpoint. Fortunately, there are some simple things users can do to ensure they don't become victims of this style of social media phishing attack. For starters, a real support account will be verified with a blue tick and won't directly ask for login credentials. A quick search for the real account should also demonstrate if the one contacting you is fake. Users may want to see their problems solved quickly, but taking ten seconds to verify who you're talking to will pay off in the long run.", "events": [{"trigger": "A phishing campaign", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "posing as", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "phishing", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "scoop up", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "Phishing", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "sending", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "lure", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "an Angler phishing campaign", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "being tailored", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "phishing attack", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "access", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "collecting", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "phishing attack", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}]}

ONWASA provides water and sewer service to all of Onslow County except Jacksonville residents. According to a press release, ONWASA's internal computer system, including servers and personal computers, have been subjected to a sophisticated ransomware attack. The attack has left the utility with limited computer capabilities. CEO Jeffrey Hudson said customer information was not compromised in the attack.

As stated in their report,     \u201cTo the best of our knowledge, all systemd-based Linux distributions are vulnerable, but SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, openSUSE Leap 15.0, and Fedora 28 and 29 are not exploitable because their user space is compiled with GCC\u2019s -fstack-clash-protection.\u201d The three bugs include two different memory corruption flaws (CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865), and an out-of-bounds flaw (CVE-2018-16866). At first, the researchers accidentally discovered CVE-2018-16864 while working on an exploit for a previously disclosed vulnerability, Mutagen Astronomy. Then, when they were busy on its PoC, they spotted the other two bugs.     \u201cWe developed a proof of concept for CVE-2018-16864 that gains eip control on i386\u2026 We developed an exploit for CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 that obtains a local root shell in 10 minutes on i386 and 70 minutes on amd64, on average.\u201d Interestingly, the bugs had been around for quite a few years. For now, Red Hat has patched the bugs CVE-2018-16864 and CVE-2018-16865. Whereas, Debian has fixed CVE-2018-16866 in the unstable systemd 240-1 release. Other distros will also supposedly release the fixes soon. In November 2018, a Google researcher also highlighted a critical flaw in Systemd that induced system crashes and hacks.", "events": [{"trigger": "have discovered", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "exist in", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "have disclosed", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "revealed", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "state", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "are vulnerable", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "discovered", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "spotted", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "developed", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "developed", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "has patched", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "has fixed", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "release", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "highlighted", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}]}
{"text": "Enigmail and GPG Tools have been patched for EFAIL. For more up-to-date information, please see EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense guides. Don\u2019t panic! But you should stop using PGP for encrypted email and switch to a different secure communications method for now. A group of researchers released a paper today that describes a new class of serious vulnerabilities in PGP (including GPG), the most popular email encryption standard. The new paper includes a proof-of-concept exploit that can allow an attacker to use the victim\u2019s own email client to decrypt previously acquired messages and return the decrypted content to the attacker without alerting the victim. The proof of concept is only one implementation of this new type of attack, and variants may follow in the coming days. Because of the straightforward nature of the proof of concept, the severity of these security vulnerabilities, the range of email clients and plugins affected, and the high level of protection that PGP users need and expect, EFF is advising PGP users to pause in their use of the tool and seek other modes of secure end-to-end communication for now. Because we are awaiting the response from the security community of the flaws highlighted in the paper, we recommend that for now you uninstall or disable your PGP email plug-in. These steps are intended as a temporary, conservative stopgap until the immediate risk of the exploit has passed and been mitigated against by the wider community. There may be simpler mitigations available soon, as vendors and commentators develop narrower solutions, but this is the safest stance to take for now. Because sending PGP-encrypted emails to an unpatched client will create adverse ecosystem incentives to open incoming emails, any of which could be maliciously crafted to expose ciphertext to attackers. While you may not be directly affected, the other participants in your encrypted conversations are likely to be. For this attack, it isn\u2019t important whether the sender or the receiver of the original secret message is targeted. This is because a PGP message is encrypted to both of their keys. At EFF, we have relied on PGP extensively both internally and to secure much of our external-facing email communications. Because of the severity of the vulnerabilities disclosed today, we are temporarily dialing down our use of PGP for both internal and external email.", "events": [{"trigger": "have been patched", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "describes", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "available", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}]}

More help is on the way for schools battling ransomware and other malware, but it has come a little late for the school which is being held to ransom for US$5000 by hackers. N4L, the Crown-owned company that manages the provision of broadband to schools, said it would improve online security as part of a wider upgrade of its managed network that is due to be completed by October next year. The 2450 schools and 800,000 students on the network will get a new security solution supplied by Californian company Fortinet which would provide \"more robust protection against online threats, such as phishing and ransomware\", it said in a statement issued on Monday. Ironically, that was the same day that staff at H\u0101wera High School switched on their computers to discover the message demanding US$5000 (NZ$7352) in bitcoin for the return of encrypted data on a server containing students' work and teaching resources.   H\u0101wera High School is connected to ultrafast broadband via N4L, but N4L chief executive Larrie Moore said the school had opted out of N4L's existing security solution and was instead using an alternative commercial offering. \"We've been in touch with the school and their IT company to offer our support,\" he said. \"Until we know how the school's network was compromised, we are unable to say whether the new Fortinet solution would have prevented it,\" he said. But Moore said there was no \"silver bullet\" for malware. Instead, technological protections needed to be used in combination with \"continuous education around good digital citizenship\", he said.  Williams said many of its students and teachers had backed up their files in the cloud and were not affected by the ransomware attack, but backups stored on servers at the school were also encrypted by the hackers. \"We have been working today on getting a clearer audit of student and staff work and where we are at. Some students are really not affected at all because they have saved their work on their cloud-based system.", "events": [{"trigger": "a ransomware attack", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "being held to ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "phishing", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "demanding", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "the ransomware attack", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}]}

The Government is not believed to have any rules on whether state-funded organisations such as schools can pay ransoms, but in 2017 it issued advice against it and Williams said the school would follow police advice not to pay. While the incident had been annoying, \"you see people's character come through and we've seen real resilience from our staff and students\", Williams said. \"It is not stopping us doing what we need to do.\"  N4L said its technology upgrade would be the first major refresh of its network since it began connecting schools with ultrafast broadband at the end of 2013.

{"text": "The US Attorney's Office for the District of Northern Georgia announced Wednesday that a federal grand jury had returned indictments against two Iranian nationals charged with executing the March 2018 ransomware attack that paralyzed Atlanta city government services for over a week. Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammed Mehdi Shah Mansouri are accused of using the Samsam ransomware to encrypt files on 3,789 City of Atlanta computers, including servers and workstations, in an attempt to extort Bitcoin from Atlanta officials. Details leaked by City of Atlanta employees during the ransomware attack, including screenshots of the demand message posted on city computers, indicated that Samsam-based malware was used. A Samsam variant was used in a number of ransomware attacks on hospitals in 2016, with attackers using vulnerable Java Web services to gain entry in several cases. In more recent attacks, including one on the health industry companies Hancock Health and Allscripts, other methods were used to gain access, including Remote Desktop Protocol hacks that gave the attackers direct access to Windows systems on the victims' networks. The Atlanta attack was not a targeted state-sponsored attack. The attackers likely chose Atlanta based on a vulnerability scan. According to the indictment, the attackers offered the city the option of paying six Bitcoin (currently the equivalent of $22,500) to get keys to unlock all the affected systems or 0.8 Bitcoin (about $3,000) for individual systems. \"The ransom note directed the City of Atlanta to a particular Bitcoin address to pay the ransom and supplied a web domain that was only accessible using a Tor browser,\" a Department of Justice spokesperson said in a statement. \"The note suggested that the City of Atlanta could download the decryption key from that website.\" But within days of the attack, the Tor page became unreachable, and the City of Atlanta did not pay the ransom. Savandi, 27, of Shiraz, Iran, and Mansouri, 34, of Qom, Iran, have been charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) for \"intentional damage to protected computers... that caused losses exceeding $5,000, affected more than 10 protected computers, and that threatened the public health and safety,\" the Justice Department spokesperson said.", "events": [{"trigger": "ransomware attack", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "extort", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "the ransomware attack", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "ransomware attacks", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "offered", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "paying", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "pay the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "pay the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}]}

{"text": "Criminals are attempting to trick consumers into handing over passwords and credit card details by taking advantage of the flood of emails being sent out ahead of new European privacy legislation. The European Union's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) come into force on 25 May and the policy is designed to give consumers more control over their online data. As a result, in the run-up to it, organisations are sending out messages to customers to gain their consent for remaining on their mailing lists. With so many of these messages being sent out, it was perhaps only a matter of time before opportunistic cybercriminals looked to take advantage of the deluge of messages about GDPR and privacy policies arriving in people's inboxes. A GDPR-related phishing scam uncovered by researchers at cyber security firm Redscan is doing just this in an effort to steal data with emails claiming to be from Airbnb. The attackers appear to be targeting business email addresses, which suggests the messages are sent to emails scraped from the web. The phishing message addresses the user as an Airbnb host and claims they're not able to accept new bookings or send messages to prospective guests until a new privacy policy is accepted.  \"This update is mandatory because of the new changes in the EU Digital privacy legislation that acts upon United States based companies, like Airbnb in order to protect European citizens and companies,\" the message says, and the recipient is urged to click a link to accept the new privacy policy.  Those who click the link are asked to enter their personal information, including account credentials and payment card information. If the user enters these, they're handing the data straight into the hands of criminals who can use it for theft, identity fraud, selling on the dark web and more. \"The irony won't be lost on anyone that cybercriminals are exploiting the arrival of new data protection regulations to steal people's data,\" said Mark Nicholls, Director of Cyber Security at Redscan. \"Scammers know that people are expecting exactly these kinds of emails this month and that they are required to take action, whether that's clicking a link or divulging personal data.

Discovered today by MalwareHunter, this application goes above and beyond of what other card stealers have attempted, most of which are half-baked efforts, often easy to recognize as malicious applications thanks to their quirky graphics and misaligned designs. This app, named \"Betaling - Google Chrome.exe\", tries to pass as the Google Chrome browser\u00a0and does a good job at it. Betaling isn't a perfect Google Chrome, though, as there are a few clues that experienced users can spot. For starters, the malicious app requires users to have installed a minimum version of .NET Framework 4.0 or higher, a requirement the real Google Chrome never had. Second, the app also uses the standard Windows 8/8.1/10 Metro style, even when running on a Windows 7 PC. Third, while Betaling tries to trick users into thinking it's the real Chrome, outside of the lock icon and the address bar, the rest of the Chrome UI is missing, such as the tab bar, the menu, Chrome buttons, and others. Users can't resize the window, can't minimize it, can't make it fullscreen, can't drag it, and can't enter a new URL. Nevertheless, much less sophisticated malware has been able to infect hundreds or thousands of users in the past, which means Betaling and its UI can be quite effective. Several security researchers who've taken a look at Betaling were impressed by its carefully crafted design. Non-infosec people thought Betaling was a phishing page loaded inside a Chrome browser, and only some time later realized they weren't looking at a Chrome window to begin with. Currently, Betaling's interface is only available in Dutch, which reveals the malware's current target. The form displayed inside the fake Chrome window isn't blind to user input like most phishing pages, and some data validation takes place, yielding two sorts of errors.

These two emails, patrick***@live.nl and patrick*******@gmail.com, are also linked to accounts on the Spokeo social network. Furthermore, Betaling's PDB file includes a compilation path of \"C:\\Users\\Patrick\\\", and the Betaling EXE file is also self-signed by an invalid certificate authority named \"CN = DESKTOP-PC\\Patrick\". Both mentions of the \"Patrick\" name are consistent with the two email addresses found in the keylogger's first log entries.

{"text": "Several developments this week recentered the security spotlight on some of the enterprise's most critical business systems as cybersecurity experts deal with the reality that enterprise resource planning (ERP) software needs heightened attention. On the vulnerability front,\u00a0SAP this week patched\u00a0a new, highly critical vulnerability for SAP HANA with one of the highest severity ratings available. Meanwhile, a new survey report shows that security professionals are finally waking up to the fact that attackers are looking to leverage vulnerabilities like these, with indicated expectations of increased ERP attacks in the near future. SAP HANA is an in-memory data platform used by enterprises to crunch data from across their business software stacks. Organizations use it to perform advanced analytics that inform critical business processes and fuel innovative applications, and as such it contains some of the most sensitive data pertaining to customers, business processes and intellectual property. The major vulnerability was discovered by ERP security firm Onapsis in SAP HANA's User Self-Service component and scored a CVSS vulnerability rating of 9.8, garnering a Hot News designation in this month's SAP Security Notes. If exploited, it would allow full remote compromise without access to any credentials. \"This level of access would allow an attacker to perform any action over the business information and processes supported by HANA, including creating, stealing, altering, and/or deleting sensitive information,\" says Sebastian Bortnik, head of research for Onapsis. SAP patched the problem in this month's round of SAP Security Notes, which included 35 vulnerabilities across its portfolio. Among them there were eight vulnerabilities with a high priority rating. Last year, the threats posed by these vulnerabilities tipped over from the theoretical realm to one of documented reality when US-CERT released a report that warned of at least 36 organizations worldwide impacted by attacks that leveraged a vulnerability in SAP's Invoker Servlet functionality running on SAP Java platforms.

{"text": "Reports released this past week by U.S. security officials and private cybersecurity researchers suggest hacking of energy facility computers is on the rise, and happens far more often than the public assumes. The Department of Homeland Security said it received reports of 59 cyber incidents at energy facilities last year, up nearly a third from the year before. The agency responsible for protecting the nation from cybercrime said it worked to mitigate 290 incidents last year across more than a dozen industries that rely on computer controls to run industrial sites, including manufacturing sites, power generation facilities, refineries, chemical plants and nuclear facilities. It found more than a quarter of these intrusions originated from so-called spear phishing emails that hackers use to trick people into downloading infected attachments or clicking on virus-laden links. More than one in 10 came from network probing and scanning. \"Every year, adversaries develop increasingly sophisticated attacks against control system networks,\" Homeland Security's Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team said. The increased number of intrusions into energy computer controls last year brings the number of such incidents in the industry to more than 400 since 2011, Homeland Security data show. Security specialists say that's likely a conservative number because energy companies aren't required to report cyberattacks to the U.S. government. In another report, cybersecurity researchers believe computer controls at industrial facilities, including in the oil business, get infected by non-targeted malware at least 3,000 times a year. Dragos Security, a cybersecurity firm in San Antonio, arrived at what it believes is a conservative estimate of worldwide industrial cyberattacks after studying 30,000 samples of infected control system files submitted over the past decade and a half to a publicly available database called VirusTotal, a web service owned by Google. The findings show malware that isn't even tailored to industrial controls finds its way into critical technology far more often than the public assumes. Some of the malware can spread through these systems with ease, and some were designed many years ago. \"If you have really bad cyber hygiene and you're not paying attention to basic things, you're more likely to get impacted by a virus that was written nine years ago,\" said Ben Miller of Dragos. For example, Miller found thousands of industrial files compromised by Sinowal, a Trojan horse first discovered in 2006.", "events": [{"trigger": "trick", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}]}

It's not clear how many of these industrial facilities were tied to the energy industry, because the VirusTotal data only provided the country of origin of the independently uploaded files. But it's yet another grim revelation for oil companies that rely on automated computer controls to run refineries, pipelines and offshore platforms. Miller said these breaches could begin during the equipment upgrades that happen when power plants, refineries and other energy facilities are taken offline for repairs. Crews of engineers, equipment contractors and information technology specialists flowing in and out of the facilities could, for example, fail to follow security protocols and accidentally plug in infected USB drives into facility systems. And they might only discover they've infected operational computers after they use the same thumb drives in corporate computers outfitted with antivirus alert systems, Miller said.", "events": [{"trigger": "None", "event_type": "None"}]}

Keylogger software intercepts the commands a keyboard sends to your computer, logging the keystrokes that make up your passwords and messages.

On Monday, Google and security firm Lookout disclosed the Android spyware, which they suspect comes from NSO Group, an Israeli security firm known to develop smartphone surveillance products. Fortunately, the spyware never hit the mainstream. It was installed less than three dozen times on victim devices, most of which were located in Israel, according to Google. Other victim devices resided in Georgia, Mexico and Turkey, among other countries. Users were probably tricked into downloading the malicious coding, perhaps though a phishing attack.

Those findings were then shared with Google, which managed to identify who was affected. However, unlike the iOS version, the Android variant doesn\u2019t actually exploit any unknown vulnerabilities. Instead, it taps known flaws in older Android versions.

Thirty-two percent of respondents said their company had been infected with ransomware with 11 percent taking longer than a week to regain access to their systems after an attack.

{"text": "The traditional model of hacking a bank isn't so different from the old-fashioned method of robbing one. But one enterprising group of hackers targeting a Brazilian bank seems to have taken a more comprehensive and devious approach: One weekend afternoon, they rerouted all of the bank's online customers to perfectly reconstructed fakes of the bank's properties, where the marks obediently handed over their account information. Researchers at the security firm Kaspersky on Tuesday described an unprecedented case of wholesale bank fraud, one that essentially hijacked a bank's entire internet footprint. In practice, that meant the hackers could steal login credentials at sites hosted at the bank's legitimate web addresses. Kaspersky researchers believe the hackers may have even simultaneously redirected all transactions at ATMs or point-of-sale systems to their own servers, collecting the credit card details of anyone who used their card that Saturday afternoon. \"Absolutely all of the bank's online operations were under the attackers' control for five to six hours,\" says Dmitry Bestuzhev, one of the Kaspersky researchers who analyzed the attack in real time after seeing malware infecting customers from what appeared to be the bank's fully valid domain. From the hackers' point of view, as Bestuzhev puts it, the DNS attack meant that \"you become the bank. Kaspersky isn't releasing the name of the bank that was targeted in the DNS redirect attack. But the firm says it's a major Brazilian financial company with hundreds of branches, operations in the US and the Cayman Islands, 5 million customers, and more than $27 billion in assets. And though Kaspersky says it doesn't know the full extent of the damage caused by the takeover, it should serve as a warning to banks everywhere to consider how the insecurity of their DNS might enable a nightmarish loss of control of their core digital assets. \"This is a known threat to the internet,\" Bestuzhev says. \"But we\u2019ve never seen it exploited in the wild on such a big scale.\" But attacking those records can take down sites or, worse, redirect them to a destination of the hacker's choosing.

{"text": "More recently, the Mirai botnet attack on the DNS provider Dyn knocked a major chunk of the web offline, including Amazon, Twitter, and Reddit. But the Brazilian bank attackers exploited their victim's DNS in a more focused and profit-driven way. Kaspersky believes the attackers compromised the bank's account at Registro.br. That's the domain registration service of NIC.br, the registrar for sites ending in the Brazilian .br top-level domain, which they say also managed the DNS for the bank. And those sites even had valid HTTPS certificates issued in the name of the bank, so that visitors' browsers would show a green lock and the bank's name, just as they would with the real sites. Kaspersky found that the certificates had been issued six months earlier by Let's Encrypt, the non-profit certificate authority that's made obtaining an HTTPS certificate easier in the hopes of increasing HTTPS adoption. \"If an entity gained control of DNS, and thus gained effective control over a domain, it may be possible for that entity to get a certificate from us,\" says Let's Encrypt founder Josh Aas. \"Such issuance would not constitute mis-issuance on our part, because the entity receiving the certificate would have been able to properly demonstrate control over the domain.\" Ultimately, the hijack was so complete that the bank wasn't even able to send email. \"They couldn\u2019t even communicate with customers to send them an alert,\" Bestuzhev says. \"If your DNS is under the control of cybercriminals, you\u2019re basically screwed.\" Aside from mere phishing, the spoofed sites also infected victims with a malware download that disguised itself as an update to the Trusteer browser security plug-in that the Brazilian bank offered customers. According to Kaspersky's analysis, the malware harvests not just banking logins\u2014from the Brazilian banks as well as eight others\u2014but also email and FTP credentials, as well as contact lists from Outlook and Exchange, all of which went to a command-and-control server hosted in Canada.

After around five hours, Kaspersky's researchers believe, the bank regained control of its domains, likely by calling up NIC.br and convincing it to correct the DNS registrations. But just how many of the bank's millions of customers were caught up in the DNS attack remains a mystery. Kaspersky says the bank hasn't shared that information with the security firm, nor has it publicly disclosed the attack. But the firm says it's possible that the attackers could have harvested hundreds of thousands or millions of customers' account details not only from their phishing scheme and malware but also from redirecting ATM and point-of-sale transactions to infrastructure they controlled. Kaspersky's Bestuzhev argues that, for banks, the incident should serve as a clear warning to check on the security of their DNS. He notes that half of the top 20 banks ranked by total assets don't manage their own DNS, instead leaving it in the hands of a potentially hackable third party. And regardless of who controls a bank's DNS, they can take special precautions to prevent their DNS registrations from being changed without safety checks, like a \"registry lock\" some registrars provide and two-factor authentication that makes it far harder for hackers to alter them.

The power is in how the malware can exploit the remote code execution vulnerability to scan for, locate and attack vulnerable systems. Once connected, the malware enables the remote attackers to gain full control of the affected device. The researchers speculate that bad actors could potentially use the Amnesia botnet to launch wide-scale DDoS attacks on a scale previously seen in the fall 2016 with the Mirai botnet. Apparently, no patches have yet been issued to address the flaw, the researchers said. As to why a patch has yet to be issued to fix this year-old flaw, Ryan Olson, intelligence director of Unit 42 at Palo Alto Networks, told SC Media on Thursday that it's up to the manufacturer to create a patch. His team hasn't found any evidence they have released one. The vulnerable DVRs are typically connected to closed circuit TV (CCTV) equipment, which are often installed in offices and stores, Olson said. \"The people operating these should limit access to those devices from the internet so they are not exposed to potential malicious actors.\"", "events": [{"trigger": "affecting", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "identified", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "is claiming", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "is impacting", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "have yet been issued to address", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "has yet to be issued to fix", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "create", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}]}

It\u2019s very likely that India tops the list soon, considering the rapid growth of ransomware. To compound it, the growth in \u201cInternet of Things\u201d (IoT) industry and the vulnerability towards cyber infections will further fuel new types of malware threats. We had reported earlier in our findings that over 180 Indian companies were victims of Ransomware online extortion schemes in the first six months of the year 2016, causing a loss of whopping $3 billion. However, the latest industry reports show a rather grim picture around Ransomware - the findings indicate that businesses in India are most at risk to cyber security attacks globally, with organizations in the country experiencing the highest number of weekly security incidents of all Asian countries surveyed (14.8 per cent). At the heart of it, Ransomware is a class of malware that\u2019s designed for moneymaking with clear criminal intent. The puzzling part about Ransomware is that, no matter what the situation is, even if the ransom is paid, there is no guarantee that computer users will be able to fully access their systems ever again. The criminal may flee with the money and the files- both! While some hackers instruct victims to pay through Bitcoin, MoneyPak or other online methods, attackers could also demand credit card data, adding another level of financial loss altogether. Cryptolocker, Petya and Dogspectus are three of the major ransomware making their presence felt strongly. Just like kidnapping for ransom, it\u2019s a virtual kidnapping of data where information is kept as a hostage and money is demanded in exchange of freeing the hostage. We all know how much damage a data breach can cost- monetarily as well as reputation wise. Once a ransomware attack strikes, clicking of files yield no results. The malware has corrupted the files and converted them into foreign MP3 files or an encrypted RSA format.

According to the research, hackers were using KasperAgent and Micropsia malware to target Windows operating system while SecureUpdate and Vamp malware were being used to target Android OS. The cybercriminals behind these attacks used two different techniques to achieve their goal. One technique involved using an URL shortener service Bit.ly to disguise the original malicious links. The motive behind these attacks was to steal credentials and spy on the victims. As per the research, hackers were targeting Educational institutes, Military organization and media companies from Palestine, Israel, Egypt, and the US. SecureUpdate, a malware disguised as an Android update was designed to download malicious payloads into the victim\u2019s device while the Vamp was focused on stealing data from victims\u2019 smartphones including call recordings, contact information, and stealing other important documents. The malware designed to target Windows operating systemsKasperAgent and Micropsia were capable of downloading other payloads, executing arbitrary commands, stealing files, capturing a screenshot, logging keystrokes and much more. Essentially the hackers were interested in stealing credentials of the infected devices. At first, no connection was established between the attacks since all the malware were different from each other. On close inspection, however, the security firms found a link. The Same email address was used to register infectious domains which eventually revealed that the attacks were linked after all.

{"text": "Updated An independent researcher claims to have uncovered a security flaw in Microsoft Edge. The issue enables any website to identify someone by their username from another website, according to Ariel Zelivansky. More specifically the bod alleges that Edge exposes the URL of any JavaScript Fetch response, in contradiction to the specification. This is a problem because it's possible to identify netizens by crafting a fetch request in a webpage that will redirect to a URL containing the visitor's username  (e.g. requesting https://facebook.com/me will pull in  https://facebook.com/username). Zelivansky alerted Microsoft but the software giant said the issue was not a security problem. El Reg also prodded Redmond only to be told the tech giant had nothing to add beyond its response to Zelivansky. The researcher went public with his findings and tipped off The Reg earlier this month after Redmond decided the issue didn't merit a security fix.

The company declined to say how many payment cards were stolen in the attack, the latest in a hacking spree on prominent hospitality companies including Hyatt\u00a0Hotels\u00a0Corp, Hilton, and Starwood\u00a0Hotels, now owned by Marriott International Inc. The breach lasted from September 29 to December 29, InterContinental\u00a0spokesman Neil Hirsch said on Wednesday. He declined to say if losses were covered by insurance or what financial impact the hacking might have on the\u00a0hotels\u00a0that were compromised, which also included Hotel Indigo, Candlewood Suites and Staybridge Suites properties. The malware searched for track data stored on magnetic stripes, which includes name, card number, expiration date and internal verification code, the company said. Hotel operators have become popular targets because they are easier to breach than other businesses that store credit card numbers as they have limited knowledge in defending themselves against hackers, said Itay Glick, chief executive of Israeli cyber-security company Votiro. \"They don't have massive data centers like banks which have very secure systems to protect themselves,\" said Glick. InterContinental\u00a0declined to say how many franchised properties it has in the United States, which is part of its business unit in the Americas with 3,633 such properties.

These W-2 forms can be used by identity thieves to claim tax rebates owed to employees, allowing the crims to pocket victims' money. The corp sent out its warning letters on April 18, the last day to file 2016 tax returns. \"The personal information that may have been accessed includes your name, address, work email address, work phone number, Social Security number, employer identification number, and wage and tax information, as well as any personal phone number, personal email address, or answers to customized security questions that you may have entered on the W-2 online portal,\" the contractor told its employees.

EyePyramid would collect information from the target's system, such as passwords, sensitive documents, and more. The malware would upload this data to various online servers or send to an email address (via SMTP). Italian officials said the two suspects, Giulio Occhionero (age 45) and Francesca Maria Occhionero (age 49), had most likely used this information for financial profits. It is unclear if this means stock market transactions or blackmail attempts. The two were discovered when one of their emails reached a security researcher, who discovered the payload and notified local police. An investigation followed, and Italian police, together with the FBI, arrested the two and seized servers used to spread the malware and store the stolen data. The two deployed their malware in separate campaigns that took place in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014.

{"text": "For almost six years, Google knew about the exact technique that someone used to trick around one million people into giving away access to their Google accounts to hackers on Wednesday. Even more worrisome: other hackers might have known about this technique as well. On October 4, 2011, a researcher speculated in a mailing list that hackers could trick users into giving them access to their accounts by simply posing as a trustworthy app. This attack, the researcher argued in the message, hinges on creating a malicious application and registering it on the OAuth service under a name like \"Google,\" exploiting the trust that users have in the OAuth authorization process. OAuth is a standard that allows users to grant websites or applications access to their online email and social networking accounts, or parts of their accounts, without giving up their passwords. It is commonly used throughout the web, and typically shows up as a menu that lets you select which of your personal accounts (such as your Google or Facebook account) you want to use to sign into or connect to another service.  If that sounds really familiar, is because that's pretty much exactly how someone tricked around one million people into giving up full access to their Google accounts to a malicious app named \"Google Doc.\" The viral, \"dynamite phishing\" scheme ripped through the internet on Wednesday for around an hour before Google shut down the malicious app and its infrastructure. (We're calling it \"dynamite phishing\" because it's basically the digital equivalent of the real thing\u2014a way to catch a bunch of users with a single blast.)  As it turns out, DeMarre claims he warned Google directly about this vulnerability in 2012, and suggested that Google address it by checking to see ensure the name of any given app matched the URL of the company behind it. In a Hacker News post, DeMarre said he reported this attack vector back then, and got a \"modest bounty\" for it. \"I'm a little surprised it has taken so long for a worm like this one to get attention,\" DeMarre told Motherboard.  A few months after he reported the issue, DeMarre said Google told him the following: \"We're deploying some abuse detection and reactive measures to deal with impostors that might try to abuse this sort of attack.", "events": [{"trigger": "trick", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "trick", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "posing as", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "creating", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "tricked", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "dynamite phishing", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "dynamite phishing", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "claims", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "warned", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "suggested", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "address", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "said", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "reported", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "reported", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "said", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}]}

Fast forward five years, and someone mimicked DeMarre's technique, creating a malicious Google Doc app that tricked millions. A similar technique has also been previously used by the Russian hacking group known as APT28 or Fancy Bear. It's possible someone else used the same technique in the last five years, without getting caught. The reason Wednesday's dynamite phishing campaign was caught and disabled quickly was because it spread so quickly and affected major media companies, which rapidly reported on the news.

On Friday, a collection of links to torrent files appeared on the anonymous publishing site PasteBin. The 9GB trove purports to be an archive of leaked emails from the party of Emmanuel Macron, the left-leaning candidate currently favored to win France's impending runoff election against far-right opponent Marine Le Pen. The latest data dump comes less than 48 hours before France's election, possibly too late to shift its outcome\u2014at least to the degree that the hacks of the DNC and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta did in the months leading up to the US election. Its timing so close to the runoff could still prove strategic, as French law forbids candidates from speaking publicly for two days ahead of an election. That timing could prevent Macron himself from responding to any scandal that surfaces in the data dump, real or fabricated. In a statement, Macron\u2019s political party confirmed that hackers had compromised it. \"The En Marche party has been the victim of a massive, coordinated act of hacking, in which diverse internal information (mails, documents, accounting, contracts) have been broadcast this evening on social networks,\" reads a public statement in French from the Macron campaign. \"The files which are circulating were obtained a few weeks ago thanks to the hacking of the professional and personal email accounts of several members of the campaign.\"  Late last month, the security firm Trend Micro noted in a report that the Macron campaign appeared to be a target of the Russian-government-linked hacker group Fancy Bear, also known as Pawn Storm or APT 28.

{"text": "A security vulnerability in Intel Corp. chips first disclosed last week\u00a0looks far worse than initially thought, as hackers can hijack Intel processors without even needing a password. The vulnerability, which affects all Intel chips manufactured since 2008, from those code-named Nahalem to today\u2019s Kaby Lake, stems from a flaw in vPro firmware suite including Intel Active Management Technology\u00a0from versions 6 to 11.6. The security hole allows\u00a0an unprivileged attacker to gain control of the manageability features provided by the firmware suite, giving a would-be hacker the same access that a systems administrator would have, including the ability to change boot up code and access the computer\u2019s mouse, keyboard, monitor and programs installed. Intel\u00a0argued that access to the vulnerability was fairly limited, in that a password was required to access AMT. But Tenable Network Security Inc. has discovered that the verification process for AMT accepts a blank password submission. As Rick Falkvinge at Private Internet Access explains: In order to get administrator privileges to the server memory, all you needed to do was to submit a blank password field instead of the expected privileged-access password hash, and you would have unlimited and unlogged read/write access to the entire server memory.

This second global hack exploits the same Microsoft vulnerabilities as the WannaCry attack and it is estimated to have infected more than 200,000 computers. The full scale of this attack, however, is still being determined due to the fact the attack is on-going.

Computers infected by this second virus do not have their functions altered, nor are their files encrypted. Instead, they manufacture digital currency.

The CloudPhishing fan-out effect occurs when a victim inadvertently shares the phishing document with colleagues, whether internal or external, via a cloud service.

Last Friday, on June 2, the hackers teased that an ABC leak was coming, when they tweeted: \"American Broadcasting Company may be up next, ladies and gentlemen.\" Early Monday morning (European timezones), the hackers made good on their promise when they tweeted out the following statement in a Pastebin post. Moments later, they tweeted a link to The Pirate Bay page where users could download the episodes. At the time of writing, only three people are attempting to download the episodes. The lack of interest is justified by this being a new game show, rather than an established brand.

The two affected Motorola models are the Moto G4 and Moto G5. The warnings come from Aleph Research which said it found the vulnerability on up-to-date handsets running the latest Motorola Android bootloader. Motorola said patches to fix the vulnerability in both devices are expected this month. \u201cExploiting the vulnerability allows the adversary to gain an unrestricted root shell. (And more!),\u201d wrote Roee Hay, manager of Aleph Research. He said vulnerable versions of the Motorola Android bootloader allow for a kernel command-line injection attack. The vulnerability (CVE-2016-10277) is the same one found by Aleph Research earlier this year and fixed by Google in May, impacting the Nexus 6 Motorola bootloader. \u201cBy exploiting the vulnerability, a physical adversary or one with authorized USB fastboot access to the device could break the secure/verified boot mechanism, allowing him to gain unrestricted root privileges, and completely own the user space by loading a tampered or malicious \u00a0image,\u201d wrote Hay.

The issues came to light yesterday when Finnish cyber-security firm F-Secure published its findings after Fosscam failed to answer bug reports and patch its firmware. Below is a list of 18 vulnerabilities researchers discovered in Fosscam IP cameras: The variety of issues F-Secure researchers discovered means there are multiple ways an attacker can hack one of these devices and use it for various operations. \"For example, an attacker can view the video feed, control the camera operation, and upload and download files from the built-in FTP server,\" F-Secure says. \" They can stop or freeze the video feed, and use the compromised device for further actions such as DDoS or other malicious activity.\" \"If the device is in a corporate local area network, and the attacker gains access to the network, they can compromise the device and infect it with a persistent remote access malware. The malware would then allow the attacker unfettered access to the corporate network and the associated resources,\" researchers added. F-Secure researchers say all these vulnerabilities have been confirmed in Fosscam C2 models, but also in Opticam i5, an IP camera sold by another vendor, but based on a white-label Fosscam device. In fact, researchers suspect that Fosscam has sold the vulnerable IP camera model as a white-label product, which other companies bought, plastered their logo on top, and resold as their own devices. F-Secure says it identified 14 other vendors that sell Fosscam made cameras, but they have not tested their products as of yet.

For CD Projekt RED, the danger is not just whether assets belonging to the game leaking into the public domain mess up its marketing strategy. There is also the risk that the gaming community will be unimpressed with any sneak previews of early versions of the game stolen by the hackers, and puncture the hype machine. Recent months have seen a rise in attacks where hackers have threatened to release a company\u2019s intellectual property onto the net unless a ransom is paid.

Both the banks suffered major data breaches in 2016 and the data of thousands of customers was later leaked online by hackers. Now, even as tensions escalate between the two Middle Eastern nations, cybercriminals appear to be cashing in on the underground cybercrime community. Hackers hit the QNB in April 2016 and the UAE InvestBank in May 2016. The Sharjah-based InvestBank's stolen data was leaked online by a hacker going by the pseudonym \"Buba\", who demanded a $3m ransom from the bank. The stolen data, including customers' financial details as well as personal details such as full names, addresses, passport numbers, phone numbers, account numbers, credit card numbers along with their CVV codes and more was leaked online by the hacker after the bank refused to pay up the ransom.  In the case of the QNB, a hacker group going by the pseudonym \"Bozkurt Hackers\" claimed responsibility for the data breach. Hackers leaked 1.4GB data, which included customers' financial records, credit card numbers and PIN codes as well as banking details pertaining to the Al-Thani Qatar Royal Family and Al Jazeera journalists. The stolen data from the QNB hack as well as the InvestBank data breach is now up for sale on an unspecified yet popular dark web marketplace, HackRead reported.

According to a report by ZDNet, independent security researcher going by the Twitter handle Xylitol uncovered the Satan malware as part of the Gen:Trojan.Heur2.FU malware family. Satan now however has been launched as part of a RaaS platform, which allows prospective cybercriminals access to ransomware in exchange for 30% of the revenues generated. Once a victim has been infected with Satan via either malicious links or phishing campaigns, the victim's files are encrypted and the attackers instruct the victims about ransom demands. Satan reportedly contains a HTML file that claims that restoring the encrypted files are impossible. According to researchers, this claim is not unfounded, indicating that the only way victims can regain access to their stolen files is by paying up the demanded ransom. Satan's ransom note instructs victims to install the Tor browser and then redirected to an .onion link to make the ransom payments. The ransom amount varies according to the specification of the cybercriminals using the RaaS platform. Those interested in the RaaS' services must connect a Bitcoin wallet to their account and point out a cost for decryption. Satan RaaS comes with several features, including fee payment records, transaction tracking, ransomware version releases and more. The platform provides hackers with tips on how to customise ransomware demands. Satan also helps hackers learn how to set up gateway proxies, and how to test their malware on systems.

Apple took a strong stance though, and other tech giants followed suite leading to a victory of sorts for (the little guy in) online privacy. In this era of web exposure, it was a step in the right direction for those who feel our online identities are increasingly vulnerable on the web. All of this stands for little though when a security flaw in your operating system allows carefully encrypted messages to be effectively decrypted offline. That\u2019s what happened to Apple with its iOS 9.2 operating system. Though the patches that ensued largely fixed the problem, the whole issue has understandably left iOS users with questions. What really happened and are we at immediate risk? A paper released in March by researchers at John Hopkins University exposed weaknesses in Apple\u2019s iMessage encryption protocol. It was found that a determined hacker could intercept the encrypted messages between two iPhones and reveal the 64-digit key used to decrypt the messages. As iMessage doesn\u2019t use a Message Authentication Code (MAC) or authenticated encryption scheme, it\u2019s possible for the raw encryption stream, or \u201cciphertext\u201d to be tampered with. iMessage instead, uses an ECDSA signature which simulates the functionality. It\u2019s still no easy feat exploiting the security flaw detailed by the researchers. The attacker would ultimately have to predict or know parts of the message they are decrypting in order to substitute these parts in the ciphertext. Knowing whether the substitution has been successful though, is a whole other process which may only be possible with attachment messages. The full details of the security flaw, and the complex way it can be exploited are detailed in the John Hopkins paper. The paper includes the recommendation that, in the long run, \u201cApple should replace the entirety of iMessage with a messaging system that has been properly designed and formally verified\u201d. One thing that should be made clear is that these weaknesses were exposed as a result of months of investigation by an expert team of cryptologists.

This is when a scammer poses as a trustworthy entity and tries tricking you into clicking on a malicious link. Their ultimate goal, of course,  is to steal your sensitive information such as credit card details, usernames and passwords. With this year's holiday online shopping numbers projected to be the biggest ever, millions of items will be processed and shipped. With this surge in shipping activity, consumer protection groups are warning everyone to watch out for fake delivery notices and package verification scams. For example, if you receive an email from \"Amazon\" saying that you have a pending delivery that needs verification from you, then that is most likely a phishing scam. Other email phishing scams may also pretend to provide you with a link for shipping updates or special discount coupons and offers. Another popular ploy is the phantom order scam. These alarming emails are meant to get you clicking by pretending you ordered thousands of dollars of merchandise. But before you click that link,  look out, these deceitful messages can be extremely convincing.

{"text": "A series of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities exist in a popular web-based SCADA system made by\u00a0Honeywell that make it easy to expose passwords and in turn, give attackers a foothold into the vulnerable network. The flaws exist in some versions of Honeywell\u2019s XL Web II controllers, systems deployed across the critical infrastructure sector, including wastewater, energy, and manufacturing companies. An advisory from the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) warned about the vulnerabilities Thursday. The company has developed a fix, version 3.04.05.05, to address the issues but users have to call their local Honeywell Building Solutions branch to receive the update, according to the company. The controllers suffer from five vulnerabilities in total but the scariest one might be the fact that passwords for the controllers are stored in clear text. Furthermore, if attackers wanted to, they could disclose that password simply by accessing a particular URL. An attacker could also carry out a path traversal attack by accessing a specific URL, open and change some parameters by accessing a particular URL, or establish a new user session. The problem with starting a new user session is that the controllers didn\u2019t invalidate any existing session identifier, something that could have made it easier for an attacker to steal any active authenticated sessions. Maxim Rupp, an independent security researcher based in Germany, dug up the bugs and teased them on Twitter at the beginning of January. Rupp has identified bugs in Honeywell equipment before. Two years ago he discovered a pair of vulnerabilities in Tuxedo Touch, a home automation controller made by the company, that could have let an attacker unlock a house\u2019s doors or modify its climate controls. It\u2019s unclear how widespread the usage of Honeywell\u2019s XL Web II controllers is.

The hacking campaign was discovered by security researcher Victor Gevers, co-founder of GDI Foundation, a non-profit organization. Gevers notified owners about the presence of vulnerable, non-password-protected MongoDB databases and also informed that around 200 of these installations have been wiped out by the hacker. Gevers believes that the hacker(s) might be utilizing an automation tool but they manually select their target databases. Hacker seems to be interested in databases that contain important information/data or he chooses companies that are most likely in a position to pay the ransom to get their data back. In a conversation with SecurityWeek, Gevers said that \u201cThey use some sort of automation tool, but they also do some of the work manually. If they used a fully automated tool, we might have seen all exposed MongoDB databases being hijacked in one swift move\u201d. But that was old news; as per recent tweet by Shodan founder John Matherly, approx. It must be noted that Shodan is the platform where a majority of MongoDB instances\u00a0can be located. As of now, 16 admins/organizations have already paid the ransom to obtain the lost data. The attacks on MongoDB databases have been going on for more than a week and servers from across the globe have been targeted.", "events": [{"trigger": "two different incidents", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "leaked", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "asking for a ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "pay the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "paid the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "The attacks", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}]}

Think back to early February 2016, when many online florists experienced a surge in traffic that wasn\u2019t due simply to a rush to buy flowers. Dozens of florists were hit by targeted DDoS attacks during their busiest time of the year, causing problems for some and knocking others offline who were asked to pay a ransom before they could resume operations. It\u2019s fairly typical for bad actors to escalate extortion-based campaigns during seasonal events when the stakes for targets are high. Looking to profit with minimal investment, attackers exploit known vulnerabilities as they attempt to breach systems. For example, the 2016 Valentine\u2019s Day DDoS attacks used Shellshock, a critical vulnerability that\u2019s present in Linux, UNIX and Mac OS X that had been discovered more than a year earlier. Of course, online florists are not alone when it comes to being targeted by cyber criminals. Different times of the year and major news events can trigger a surge in attacks aimed at particular industries and geographies.

{"text": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is placing an unprecedented number of unsecured devices on the Internet every day that are being leveraged by hackers to steal data and to launch Denial of Service Attacks (DDoS). These devices are coming in the form of thermostats, refrigerators, pet feeders, cameras, healthcare devices, and more. Gartner estimates that by 2020, 50 Billion connected \u201cthings\u201d will be on the internet. Pushing the escalation of DDoS attacks is the release of the Mirai code which has opened the door for hackers to create their own code to access the vast varieties of IoT devices to be leveraged as bots designed to launch massive DDoS attacks. This trend is gaining momentum in the threat landscape as hackers experiment with the Mirai code to boost the impact of their DDoS attacks as evidenced by the recent discovery of a record-setting 12.2-day DDoS attack. What comes next is an exponential windfall for hackers with the introduction of Smart Dust. Smart Dust is the term used to describe very small chips containing a system of tiny microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) such as sensors, robots, or other devices that can, for example, gather and send sensory data such as temperature, vibration, GPS coordinates and more to an internet host where the data can be stored and analyzed. These chips are microscopic, can be airborne and will be able to run for years without external power. Professor Julie McCann takes her inspiration from nature for writing algorithms that allow distributed wireless networks to become self-organizing, adaptive and intelligent. Smart Dust will be manufactured inexpensively, making it possible to integrate into a variety of products including food or merchandise packaging as a means of tracking. Smart Dust embedded into a variety of disposable products will eventually end up in a landfill still connected and capable of communicating to the internet via 6LoWPAN. With the longevity associated with these MEMs and the ability to run without external power, hackers will have unprecedented opportunity to access these unsecured MEMs that can be used to create massively distributed botnets.

The fraudsters request the email or phone number of the institution\u2019s head teacher or financial administrator claiming they need to send guidance forms to the individual directly, as they contain sensitive information. The emails, however, have a .ZIP file attached, which often contains a boobytrapped Word document or Excel spreadsheet which initiates the ransomware infection.

Similar scams have posed as being from telecoms providers claiming to need to speak to the head teacher about \u201cinternet systems\u201d or the Department of Work and Pensions.

{"text": "Android users were the target of new banking malware with screen locking capabilities, which was disguised as a weather forecast app on Google Play. Detected by ESET as Trojan.Android/Spy.Banker.HU, the malware was a trojanized version of the otherwise benign weather forecast application Good Weather. The malicious app managed to get around Google\u2019s security mechanisms and appeared in the store on February 4th, only to be reported by ESET two days later and consequently pulled from the store. During its short lifetime, the app found its way to devices of up to 5000 users. Besides the weather forecast functionalities it adopted from the original legitimate application, the trojan is able to lock and unlock infected devices remotely\u00a0and intercept text messages. Apart from doing so, the trojan targeted the users of 22 Turkish mobile banking apps, whose credentials were harvested using phony login forms. The infected device then displays a fake system screen requesting device administrator rights on behalf of fictitious \u201cSystem update\u201d. By enabling these rights, the victim allows the malware to Change the screen-unlock password and Lock the screen. Users who are not alarmed at this point might be pleased with the new weather widget they can add to their home screens. However, in the background, the malware is getting to work sharing device information with its C&C server. Depending on the command it gets in return, it can intercept received text messages and send them to the server, remotely lock and unlock the device by setting a lock screen password of the attackers\u2019 choice, and harvest banking credentials. The trojan displays a fake login screen once the user runs one of the targeted banking apps and sends entered data to the attacker. Thanks to the permission to intercept the victims\u2019 text messages, the malware is also able to bypass SMS-based two-factor authentication. As for the device locking, we suspect this function enters the picture when cashing out the compromised bank account, to keep the fraudulent activity hidden from the user. Once locked out, all victims can do is wait until the malware receives a command to unlock the device.

{"text": "One tried-and-true technique continues to be hiding malware inside fake versions of popular files, then distributing those fake versions via app stores. Doing the same via peer-to-peer BitTorrent networks has also long been popular. But as with so many supposedly free versions of paid-for applications, users may get more than they bargained for. To wit, last week researchers at the security firm ESET spotted new ransomware - Filecoder.E - circulating via BitTorrent, disguised as a \"patcher\" that purports to allow Mac users to crack such applications as Adobe Premiere Pro CC and Microsoft Office 2016. As Toronto-based security researcher Cheryl Biswas notes in a blog post: \"For those who torrent, be careful. ESET says the ransomware can also encrypt any Time Machine backups on network-connected volumes that are mounted at the time of the attack. If the ransomware infects a system, it demands 0.25 bitcoins - currently worth about $300 - for a decryption key. But ESET security researcher Marc-Etienne M.L \u00c9veill\u00e9, in a blog post, says the application is so poorly coded that there's no way that a victim could ever obtain a decryption key. So far, ESET reports that the single bitcoin wallet tied to the ransomware has received no payments. \"There is one big problem with this ransomware: It doesn't have any code to communicate with any C&C; server,\" says \u00c9veill\u00e9, referring to a command-and-control server that might have been used to remotely control the infected endpoint. \"This means that there is no way the key that was used to encrypt the files can be sent to the malware operators. This also means that there is no way for them to provide a way to decrypt a victim's files.\" The longstanding ransomware-defense advice, of course, is to never pay ransoms, because this directly funds cybercrime groups' ongoing research and development. Instead, stay prepared: Keep complete, disconnected backups of all systems, and periodically test that they can be restored, and thus never have to consider paying a ransom. \"We advise that victims never pay the ransom when hit by ransomware,\" \u00c9veill\u00e9 says.", "events": [{"trigger": "distributing", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "disguised as", "event_type": "Attack:Phishing"}, {"trigger": "the attack", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "demands", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "never pay ransoms", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "paying a ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "pay the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}]}

VenusLocker first appeared in October 2016; it got a refresh two months later.

{"text": "A new phishing campaign is using a fake iTunes receipt for movie purchases to compromise Apple users' sensitive information. Fortinet researchers first spotted the phishing campaign over the weekend of 17 February. The attack begins when an Apple user receives a receipt that appears to have come from iTunes. In actuality, an email address based in Norway sent the message. The receipt lists purchases for a series of movies. These films (which include \"Allied\", \"Arrival\", and \"Jack Reacher: Never Go Back\") debuted in theaters recently, which makes the ruse relevant and consequently more believable. This email isn't the first time phishers (or smishers, for that matter) have targeted Apple users. Users in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States have witnessed similar attacks over the past few years. This particular campaign targets Canadian users and seems to have improved upon earlier iterations of the scam. Of course, most users who receive the receipt will wonder why they've been charged so much money for something they haven't purchased. Their attention will subsequently go to the link at the bottom of the email that claims they can obtain a full refund. But clicking on the link doesn't help them in the slightest. As explained by Fortinet's researchers: \"At the bottom of the receipt, there\u2019s a link to request a \u201cfull refund\u201d in case of an unauthorized transaction. Apple has no need for a user's Social insurance number, which Canadians need to work for or to access government services, or their mother's maiden name. But the phishers want their targets to overlook that fact and enter their details. Indeed, doing so would help the attackers assume control of their victim's credit card and other financial information. This campaign, like so many others, demonstrates the importance of carefully reviewing suspicious emails. Users should look at the sending email address to see if it's legitimate. If they come across an invoice or receipt for a credit card purchase, they should check their account history for such a transaction. If they don't find anything, that means scammers are just trying to scare them into handing over their payment card details.

This sort of email is not common, but is frequent enough in Sr Management circles, especially if you are in the middle of merger or acquisition discussions with another company. Some technical warning signs in that note were: So the discussion quickly moved from \"I'm glad our execs came to us, we really dodged a bullet there\" to \"just how did this get in the door past our spam filter anyway?\" Their SPAM filter does use the SPF (Sender Policy Framework) DNS TXT record, and a quick check on the SPF indicated that things looked in order there.

A properly formed SPF will end with a \"-\", which essentially means \"mail senders in this SPF record are valid for this domain, and no others\". However, their SPF had a typo - their record ended in a \"~\" instead. What the tilde character means to this spam filter is \"the mail senders in this SPF record are valid for this domain, but YOLO, so is any other mail sender\". From the RFC (RFC7208), the ~ means \"softfail\", \"A \"softfail\" result is a weak statement by the publishing ADMD that the host is probably not authorized\". More detail appears later in the RFC: \"A \"softfail\" result ought to be treated as somewhere between \"fail\" and \"neutral\"/\"none\". The ADMD believes the host is not authorized but is not willing to make a strong policy statement. Receiving software SHOULD NOT reject the message based solely on this result, but MAY subject the message to closer scrutiny than normal. \"\u00a0 This same reasoning applies to the ~all and -all directives in the SPF (which I see more often).

A little bit of research can make for a really well-formed phish, right down to using the right people in the conversation, good grammar, and phrasing appropriate to the people involved. So a bit of homework can get an attacker a really nice payday, especially if their campaign targets a few hundred companies at a time (and they put more work into their email than the example above) So in this case, a typo in a DNS record could have cost millions of dollars.

While significant additional security measures were implemented in response to those incidents, it appears certain senior executives did not properly comprehend or investigate, and therefore failed to act sufficiently upon, the full extent of knowledge known internally by the Company\u2019s information security team.", "events": [{"trigger": "hack attacks", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "compromised", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "been hacked", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "were exposed", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "had been stolen", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "the incident", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}]}

However, the Independent Committee did not conclude that there was an intentional suppression of relevant information. Nonetheless, the Committee found that the relevant legal team had sufficient information to warrant substantial further inquiry in 2014, and they did not sufficiently pursue it. As a result, the 2014 Security Incident was not properly investigated and analyzed at the time, and the Company was not adequately advised with respect to the legal and business risks associated with the 2014 Security Incident. The Independent Committee found that failures in communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting contributed to the lack of proper comprehension and handling of the 2014 Security Incident.", "events": [{"trigger": "had exfiltrated", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}]}

{"text": "Attributing hacking attacks to the correct perpetrators is notoriously difficult. Even the U.S. government, for all its technical resources and expertise, took warranted criticism for trying to pin a high-profile 2014 cyberattack on North Korea, and more recently faced skepticism when it blamed Russia for hacks against top Democrats during the 2016 election. In those cases, government officials said they based their attribution in part on software tools the hackers employed, which had been used in other cyberattacks linked to North Korea and Russia. But that sort of evidence is not conclusive; hackers have been known to intentionally use or leave behind software and other distinctive material linked to other groups as part of so-called false flag operations intended to falsely implicate other parties. Researchers at Russian digital security firm Kaspersky Lab have documented such cases. On Tuesday, WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA documents that it said showed the agency had equipped itself to run its own false-flag hacking operations. The documents describe an internal CIA group called UMBRAGE that WikiLeaks said was stealing the techniques of other nation-state hackers to trick forensic investigators into falsely attributing CIA attacks to those actors. According to WikiLeaks, among those from whom the CIA has stolen techniques is the Russian Federation, suggesting the CIA is conducting attacks to intentionally mislead investigators into attributing them to Vladimir Putin. \u201cWith UMBRAGE and related projects, the CIA can not only increase its total number of attack types, but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the \u2018fingerprints\u2019 of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from,\u201d WikiLeaks writes in a summary of its CIA document dump. It\u2019s a claim that seems intended to shed doubt on the U.S. government\u2019s attribution of Russia in the DNC hack; the Russian Federation was the only nation specifically named by WikiLeaks as a potential victim of misdirected attribution. It\u2019s also a claim that some media outlets have accepted and repeated without question. \u201cWikiLeaks said there\u2019s an entire department within the CIA whose job it is to \u2018misdirect attribution by leaving behind the fingerprints\u2019 of others, such as hackers in Russia,\u201d CNN reported without caveats.", "events": [{"trigger": "was stealing", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "has stolen", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}, {"trigger": "were stolen", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}]}

Instead, they indicate the UMBRAGE group is doing something much less nefarious. They say UMBRAGE is borrowing hacking \u201ctechniques\u201d developed or used by other actors to use in CIA hacking projects.

{"text": "Western Digital My Cloud NAS devices have again been found wanting in the security department, as two set of researchers have revealed a number of serious flaws in the devices\u2019 firmware. WD My Cloud is meant to be a private cloud environment hosted at home or at a small organization\u2019s office, and can be accessed either from a desktop located on the same network or remotely, with a smartphone, from wherever else in the world. Users can interact with it either via the administrative user interface or an application (that uses a RESTful API). Zenofex, a member of the Exploitee.rs team, revealed the existence of a login bypass issue, several command injection flaws, and a number of other bugs on Saturday. Then, on Tuesday, researchers with the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab published a security advisory warning about:  \u201cDue to [no anti-CSRF mechanisms], an attacker can force a user to execute any action through any script. As the [OS command injection and unauthenticated arbitrary file upload vulnerabilities] do not need authentication, those can be exploited via CSRF over the Internet as well!\u201d, the researchers noted. SEC consult found the flaws in version 2.11.157 of the firmware on a My Cloud EX2 device, but they believe that other My Cloud devices are almost surely vulnerable as well, as the same (or pretty much the same) firmware is used on all of them. Zenofex did his testing on a My Cloud PR4100 device, but also noted that other My Cloud devices are vulnerable to the same issues. In the wake of these latest revelations, Securify researchers again pointed to their own research and security advisories from January 2017 dealing with the same or similar vulnerabilities, found on versions 2.21.119 and 2.21.126 of the firmware. All three groups say that the issues have yet to be fixed by Western Digital. SEC Consult researchers complained about the company slow reaction to their responsable disclosure efforts, while Zenofex noted that the company\u2019s dismal reputation when it comes to patching reported issues. So, he opted for public disclosure, in the hopes that this will push the company to pick up the pace. \u201cIgnoring these bugs would leave the vulnerable devices online for longer periods while responsible disclosure is worked out.", "events": [{"trigger": "been found", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "have revealed", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "revealed", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "be exploited", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "found", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "are almost surely vulnerable", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "are vulnerable", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "found", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "be fixed", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "their responsable disclosure", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "patching", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "public disclosure", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}, {"trigger": "responsible disclosure", "event_type": "Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability"}]}

{"text": "Anonymous also leaked a majority of data from Freedom Hosting II, which included over 380,000 user records. Now we have learned that after the abovementioned cyber-attack, the number of hidden services on the Dark Web has lowered significantly. This revelation was made after an analysis was carried out using OnionScan. According to the OnionScan report, out of over 30,000 Tor-based hidden services, only 4,400 are active on the Dark Web currently. It is much lower in comparison to previous such scans, stated the OnionScan project operator Sarah Jamie Lewis. This is why, noted Lewis, the number of hidden services has reduced so much including the secure email platform Sigaint, which went offline unannounced in mid-February. Apart from the absence of such a huge number of hidden services, the scan report also detected 4,000 HTTP services, 250 TLS services, 270 SSH services, 100 SMTP services, 220 Bitcoin nodes and some FTP and VNC services too on the Dark Web. Here the question arises, why Tor-based services have been removed? The reason could be that a majority of users have started to perceive Dark Web as a platform dedicated to criminality oriented or illegal activities. Furthermore, it is a fact that just like maintaining anonymity on Tor is difficult in the same manner hosting a hidden service on the Dark Web is daunting as it required high-level skills and technical abilities.", "events": [{"trigger": "leaked", "event_type": "Attack:Databreach"}]}
