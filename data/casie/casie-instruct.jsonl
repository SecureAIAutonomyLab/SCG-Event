The former worker, Kristi Sims, was arrested Thursday; officers recovered the stolen files after executing search warrants, according to CPS and Chicago police officials. Sims, 28, is a former contractor who handled administrative tasks for the Office of Safety and Security. Sims was ordered released on her own recognizance at a bond hearing Friday at the Leighton Criminal Court Building by Judge Sophia Atcherson; Sims also was ordered not to access to the internet while the case continues. In a letter to employees Thursday evening, CPS Chief Operating Officer Arnie Rivera said the district learned of the massive data breach Wednesday, the day after the information was stolen. Among the data stolen were names, employee ID numbers, phone numbers, addresses, dates of birth, criminal arrest histories and DCFS findings. Social Security numbers were not taken, Rivera said. \u201cThere was no indication that the information, which was in the individual\u2019s possession for approximately 24 hours, was used or disseminated to anyone in any way,\u201d Rivera added. A CPS spokesman referred questions about the criminal charges to Chicago police, but Rivera said \u201cCPS will work to ensure the individual is prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d CPD spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said Sims is also suspected of deleting the targeted files from the CPS database after they were stolen. The digital equipment seized in the warrant is being analyzed, and a search warrant is underway for Sims\u2019s email account, Guglielmi said. Though police say they don\u2019t believe anyone other than Sims was in possession of the data, they hope to learn more about what might have been done with the information. This latest CPS data breach comes only a few months after the school district mistakenly sent a mass email that linked to the private information of thousands of students and families. The email invited families to submit supplemental applications to selective enrollment schools. Attached at the bottom of the email was a link to a spreadsheet with the personal data of more than 3,700 students and families. In that incident, CPS apologized for the \u201cunacceptable breach of both student information and your trust\u201d and asked recipients of the email to delete the sensitive information.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: stole, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the data stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were not taken, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Customers reported receiving an email on Tuesday stating that the company had identified an attempt to access eurostar.com accounts using users' email and passwords between the 15 and 19 of October.  Eurostar confirmed that credit card details and payment details were not compromised because the company does not store that information online.  Eurostar has yet to confirm how many people have been affected by this data breach or whether any data has been taken.  The company has reported the data breach to the Information Commissioner's Office. \"We have taken this action as a precaution because we identified what we believe to be an unauthorised automated attempt to access eurostar.com accounts using your email address and password,\" the company told customers.  \"We've since carried out an investigation which shows that your account was logged into between the 15 and 19 October. If you didn't log in during this period, there's a possibility your account was accessed by this unauthorised attempt.\" Customers were told to check their accounts for \"anything unusual\" and update login details on any other site where they use the same password. A Eurostar spokesman said: \"This email was sent after we identified what we believe to be an unauthorised automated attempt to access customer accounts, so as a precaution, we asked all account holders to reset their password. We deliberately never store any payment details or bank card information, so there is no possibility of those being compromised.\" An ICO spokesman said: \u201cWe\u2019ve received data breach report from Eurostar and are making enquiries.\u201d Last week, British Airways revealed that almost 200,000 further passengers may have had their personal data stolen by hackers in the September attack in what experts described as one of the biggest breaches of consumer data the UK had ever seen.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: were not compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: this data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: has been taken, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was accessed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: being compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: attack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Amid calls for more stringent regulations on personal data protection, lawmaker Horace Cheung Kwok-kwan from the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong said Legco will hold a special meeting on Nov 14 to thoroughly discuss how to prevent similar incidents from happening again through regulatory approaches. According to Cheung, the meeting will be attended by members of the Legco Panel on Constitutional Affairs, which he chairs, Panel on Security and Panel on Information Technology and Broadcasting, as well as representatives from the airline, the Hong Kong Economic Journal reported. Secretary for Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Patrick Nip Tak-kuen and Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data Stephen Wong Kai-yi have also agreed to join the discussions, he added. Cheung said quite a number of his colleagues have expressed concerns about the fact that the existing regulations on online privacy have failed to advance with the time, and want to know the view of the authorities on reforming them. Cathay revealed on Oct 23 that it discovered suspicious activity on its computer network in early March and confirmed in early May that personal data of its customers were accessed with no authorization. The data included passenger name, nationality, date of birth, phone number, email, physical addresses, passport number, identity card number, frequent flyer program membership number, customer service remarks, and historical travel information, along with the numbers of hundreds of credit cards. On Monday morning, eight officers from the police\u2019s Cyber Security and Technology Crime Bureau went to Cathay City, the airline\u2019s headquarters at the Hong Kong International Airport in Chek Lap Kok, to conduct an investigation. With the presence of a Cathay-appointed lawyer, the officers examined some servers before they left about two hours later without taking away any items as evidence. It is understood that the police force has instructed all of its districts to pay attention to cases that may be connected to the data breach or those resulting in material losses. Meanwhile, Wong told a radio program on Monday that his office, the next day after the airline unveiled it, sent an initial questionnaire, asking Cathay for an explanation within 10 days.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were accessed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data, Hong Kong (PCPD) would proactively contact the airline and initiate a compliance check. The Privacy Commissioner advised the airline to notify the affected clients as soon as possible, and take remedial steps with details explained immediately. Mr Wong said that organisations must take effective security measures to protect the personal data of its clients. If an external service provider is engaged as a data processor, the organisation must adopt contractual or other means to safeguard personal data from unauthorised or accidental access, processing or use. Mr Wong reminded members of the public that if they find any abnormalities with their personal accounts of the airline concerned or credit card accounts, they should contact the airline and the related financial institutions.  They should also change the account passwords and enable two-factor authentication to protect their personal data.

Cathay said 860,000 passport numbers, about 245,000 Hong Kong identity card numbers, 403 expired credit card numbers and 27 credit card numbers with no card verification value (CVV) were accessed in the breach. \"We are very sorry for any concern this data security event may cause our passengers,\" Cathay Pacific chief executive Rupert Hogg said in a statement. \"We acted immediately to contain the event, commence a thorough investigation with the assistance of a leading cyber-security firm, and to further strengthen our IT security measures.\" Mr Hogg said no passwords were compromised in the breach and the company was contacting affected passengers to give them information on how to protect themselves. Cathay Pacific was not immediately available for additional comment outside normal business hours. The company said it initially discovered suspicious activity on its network in March this year, and investigations in early May confirmed that certain personal data had been accessed.

While the incident took place on Monday, the complainant, realised that his data has been blocked on Tuesday. \u201cA case of ransomware was reported, following which, an FIR has been registered at the Bhoiwada police station,\u201d said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 4) N Ambika. While the FIR was lodged on Thursday, no arrest has been made in the case yet. Police said the incident took place on Monday at the complainant\u2019s office near Framroz court in Dadar. Around 2.15 pm, a message flashed on the complainant\u2019s computer screen saying, \u201cYou have to pay for decryption in bitcoins. The price depends on how fast you write to us. After payment, we will send you the decryption key, which will decrypt all your files.\u201d The message also had an email address, on which he was to write to the fraudsters. Around 7 pm, when the complainant tried to use a computer for some work, he could not access the data. When he tried other computers, he faced the same problem. He also found that some data and software had been deleted. Suspecting that a computer virus may be behind this, he copied the other files still available from the computer. The complainant then left for the day and asked an employee from the information technology department to look into the matter. The employee later told him that the data had not been deleted but encrypted by fraudsters. On Sunday, the MGM hospital in Navi Mumbai was attacked by a ransomware.

The company, which is listed on Australia's ASX stock exchange, announced the breach late Thursday. The announcement came just a day after a security researcher in France posted screenshots on Twitter of the purported stolen data. Austal says the material is neither sensitive nor classified and that it has taken steps to secure its data systems.  \"The data breach has had no impact on Austal's ongoing operations,\" the company says.  Austal's business in the United States is unaffected by this issue, as the computer systems are not linked. A spokesman for Austal contacted on Friday says he couldn't offer further information on the incident. The breach exposed ship design drawings that are distributed to customers, fabrication subcontractors and suppliers, Austal says. It also exposed \"some staff email addresses and mobile phone numbers.\" Those individuals have been informed as well as a \"small number\" of other stakeholders directly impacted by the breach, the company reports. Austal has contacted the Australian Cyber Security Center and the Australian Federal Police. The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, which enforces the country's data protection regulations \"will be involved as required,\" Austal says.  Companies are increasingly being subjected to ransoms by hackers after their networks have been breached. Ransoms put companies in tough positions: risk public exposure of potentially embarrassing data, or risk paying a ransom and still face a chance the data could be released anyway. Security experts and law enforcement generally advise against paying ransoms, even after incidents of file-encrypting malware. But some companies have viewed the situation as either a cost of doing business or a shorter route to recovery. Late last month in the U.S, the city of West Haven, Connecticut, paid $2,000 to unlock 23 servers that had been infected with ransomware (see: Connecticut City Pays Ransom After Crypto-Locking Attack).

Officials discovered on Tuesday that servers had been targeted in a ransomware attack that  blocked them from obtaining access to material relating to major golf tournaments, including this week\u2019s PGA Championship at Bellerive Country Club. Some signage had been in development for over a year and could not be reproduced quickly, Golfweek reported. The extortion threat was clear: Transfer bitcoin to the hackers or lose the files forever. \u201cYour network has been penetrated. All files on each host in the network have been encrypted with a strong algorythm (sic),\u201d a ransom read. \u201cBackups were either encrypted or deleted or backup disks were formatted.\u201d The note claimed shutting down the system may damage files. The notice included a bitcoin wallet number\u2014where funds could be sent\u2014and a warning that there was no way to get access to the files without a decryption key. The hackers that said they would prove their \u201chonest intentions\u201d to the PGA of America by unlocking two files free-of-charge. A source who asked not to be named told Golfweek that officials had no intention of paying the ransom demand\u2014following the advice of most law enforcement officials and cybersecurity experts. The network remained locked on Wednesday and external researchers are still investigating. PGA of America has declined to comment.

The assault on Hollywood Presbyterian occurred Feb 5, when hackers using malware infected the institution's computers, preventing hospital staff from being able to communicate from those devices, said Chief Executive Allen Stefanek. The hacker demanded 40 bitcoin, the equivalent of about $17,000, he said. \"The malware locks systems by encrypting files and demanding ransom to obtain the decryption key. The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key,\" Stefanek said. \"In the best interest of restoring normal operations, we did this.\" The hospital said it alerted authorities and was able to regain control of all its computer systems by Monday, with the assistance of technology experts. Stefanek said patient care was never compromised, nor were hospital records. Top hospital officials called the Los Angeles Police Department last week, according to police Lt John Jenal. Laura Eimiller, an FBI spokeswoman, said the bureau has taken over the hacking investigation but declined to discuss specifics of the case.

These records were all part of a 53 GB database that was available for purchase from Dun & Bradstreet, a business service firm. The database contained information that could be of great use to hackers and marketers alike, as it outlined corporate data for businesses within the United States, providing professional details and contact information for members at every level of the businesses included. Dun & Bradstreet released a statement via email in an attempt to remove the firm from any responsibility. According to the firm, there was no evidence of a breach on their systems. The email also pointed out that the leaked data was sold to \u201cthousands\u201d of other companies, and that the leaked data seemed to be six months old. In essence, Dun & Bradstreet\u2019s position was \u201cnot our fault.,\u201d and that there was little cause for worry, as the list only contained \u201cgenerally publicly available business contact data.\u201d However, not everyone feels that the responsibility for this event can be passed off so easily, especially considering the nature of the data found on the database. Troy Hunt manages Have I Been Pwned, a data leak alert site that allows a user to reference one of their accounts to determine if their credentials have been compromised. He offered up his own take after reviewing the database for himself. Hunt\u2019s analysis revealed that the organizations with the most records in the database were:     The United States Department Of Defense: 101,013     The United States Postal Service: 88,153     AT&T Inc.: 67,382     Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.: 55,421     CVS Health Corporation: 40,739     The Ohio State University: 38,705     Citigroup Inc.: 35,292     Wells Fargo Bank, National Association: 34,928     Kaiser Foundation Hospitals: 34,805     International Business Machines Corporation: 33,412 If this list alarms you, you have the right idea.

Ransomware is no longer just a nuisance. Now it's quite literally a matter of life and death. A massive ransomware attack being labeled as \"WannaCry\" has been reported around the world and is responsible for shutting down hospitals in the United Kingdom and encrypting files at Spanish telecom firm Telefonica. The WannaCry attack is not a zero-day flaw, but rather is based on an exploit that Microsoft patched with its MS17-010 advisory on March 14 in the SMB Server. However, Microsoft did not highlight the SMB flaw until April 14, when a hacker group known as the Shadow Brokers released a set of exploits, allegedly stolen from the U.S.National Security Agency. SMB, or Server Message Block, is a critical protocol used by Windows to enable file and folder sharing. It's also the protocol that today's WannaCry attack is exploiting to rapidly spread from one host to the next around the world, literally at the speed of light. The attack is what is known as a worm, \"slithering\" from one host to the next on connected networks. Among the first large organizations to be impacted by WannaCry is The National Health Service in the UK, which has publicly confirmed that it was attacked by the Wanna Decryptor. \"This attack was not specifically targeted at the NHS and is affecting organisations from across a range of sectors,\" the NHS stated. \"At this stage we do not have any evidence that patient data has been accessed.\" Security firm Kaspersky Lab reported that by 2:30 p.m. ET May 12 it had already seen more than 45,000 WannaCry attacks in 74 countries. While the ransomware attack is making use of the SMB vulnerability to spread, the encryption of files is done by the Wanna Decryptor attack that seeks out all files on a victim's network. Once the ransomware has completed encrypting files, victims are presented with a screen demanding a ransom. Initially, the ransom requested was reported to be $300 worth of Bitcoin, according to Kaspersky Lab.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: WannaCry, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The WannaCry attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: did not highlight, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: WannaCry attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was attacked, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: This attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: has been accessed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: WannaCry attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the Wanna Decryptor attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom requested, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Hackers used a flaw in the web server running the website of ABTA, the UK's largest holiday and travel association, to access the data of as many as 43,000 people. ABTA CEO Mark Tanzer says an \"external infiltrator\" used a vulnerability in the firm's web server to access data provided by its members and some of those members' customers. ABTA is the UK's largest travel association, representing travel agents and tour operators that sell \u00a332bn of holidays and other travel each year. It said the unauthorised access -- on 27 February 2017 -- may have affected 43,000 individuals. Around 1,000 of the accessed files may include personal identity information relating to customers of ABTA members, submitted in support of their complaint about an ABTA member. These files relate to complaints uploaded to ABTA after 11 January 2017. Additionally, around 650 files may include personal identity information of ABTA members. But Tanzer said: \"We are not aware of any information being shared beyond the infiltrator.\" The travel trade association said the vast majority of the 43,000 were people who had registered on abta.com, with email addresses and encrypted passwords, or have filled in an online form with basic contact details \"which are types of data at a very low exposure risk to identity theft or online fraud\". Once it became aware of the intrusion, ABTA notified the third-party suppliers of the abta.com website, who immediately fixed the vulnerability, and the association hired risk consultants to assess the potential extent of the incident. It has also alerted the Information Commissioner and the police. \"It is extremely disappointing that our web server, managed for ABTA through a third party web developer and hosting company, was compromised, and we are taking every step we can to help those affected,\" said Tanzer. ABTA said its own systems remained secure and the vulnerability was in the web server for abta.com, which is managed for ABTA through a third-party web developer and hosting company. The association said that ABTA members or members of the public who have registered on abta.com should immediately change their password and, if they used this password or any variation of it for other accounts, they should change that too.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: unauthorised access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: being shared, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The indictment names two FSB agents \u2014 Igor Suschin and Dmitry Dokuchaev \u2014 who allegedly contracted two criminal hackers \u2014 Aleksey Belan and Karim Baratov \u2014 to compromise Yahoo\u2019s database, which included both US military officers and Russian journalists believed to be of interest to the FSB. Baratov was arrested yesterday in Canada, Department of Justice officials say. \u201cThere are no free passes for foreign, state-sponsored criminal behavior,\u201d Assistant Attorney General McCord told reporters at a press conference. When Yahoo first disclosed the breach in September, the company attributed the attack to \u201ca state-sponsored actor,\u201d a claim that some security experts found questionable at the time. Subsequent reports found that the Yahoo database was sold a number of times, suggesting a criminal profit motive rather than intelligence gathering. According to the Department of Justice, that was a result of the FSB\u2019s collaboration with its criminal contractors, who sold much of the stolen information after it had been handed over. One of the contractors also allegedly searched the accounts for gift cards and other financial info. Yahoo\u2019s database was breached two separate times during the period \u2014 once in August 2013 and again in late 2014, revealing account details for hundreds of millions of users each time. Today\u2019s charges deal only with the 2014 breach, which compromised 500 million accounts. Many blamed Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer for refusing to invest in more robust security measures. Mayer later acknowledged the error, and gave up her annual salary, bonus and equity grant for 2016 as a result. Details of the breaches became public only after Yahoo had struck a deal to be acquired by Verizon. News of the security issues caused significant friction in the deal, ultimately causing Verizon to lower its purchase price by $350 million, to $4.4 billion dollars.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: compromise, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was sold, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was breached, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The gang calls themselves the \"Turkish Crime Family,\" and they're demanding $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrency. In a bizarre twist, they're also willing to accept $100,000 in iTunes gift cards as an alternative form of payment, despite the obvious concern that Apple would easily be able to track this. In return, the hacker group would delete their entire collection of compromising data. According to Motherboard, a hacker has been quoted as saying: I just want my money and thought this would be an interesting report that a lot of Apple customers would be interested in reading and hearing. Apparently, one of the hackers shared screenshots of emails exchanged between the group and Apple, and then gave Motherboard's Joseph Cox access to the email account as proof. The hackers claim to have over 300 million Apple email accounts, including ones with @icloud and @me domains. Later on, though, another hacker from the group claimed that they actually have 559 million accounts. The only other proof they provided was a YouTube video of the hackers allegedly logging into an elderly woman's stolen iCloud account to view backed-up photos, then wiping her device, but this video has since been removed. Lending to the credibility of the hackers' claims, though, Apple is stated to have asked the hacker group to remove the video from YouTube: We firstly kindly request you to remove the video that you have uploaded on your YouTube channel as it's seeking unwanted attention, second of all we would like you to know that we do not reward cyber criminals for breaking the law. Cox also states that he read other emails in their account, and that it appeared the hackers have tried to approach many different media outlets to get more attention, possibly to help their extortion efforts. Now, we don't know how true the Turkish Crime Family's claims are, but this is a good time to remind you to frequently change your passwords. Make them strong and unique, people!

This comes after a recent report from Motherboard that a hacker gang called the \"Turkish Crime Family\" is threatening to remotely wipe up to 559 million iPhones by April 7. The hackers claim they hold an alleged cache of stolen accounts, and their goal is to shake down the big Apple for $75,000 in Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrency. Alternatively, in lieu of those options, they will even accept $100,000 in iTunes gift cards (a potentially risky option for them). Apple responded to the allegation that the hackers breached its systems, assuring their systems were not compromised, but did not confirm if the hackers do in fact hold an entire collection of Apple IDs and passwords. Whatever information they do have, probably came from previously comprised third-parties. \"If the list is legitimate, it was not obtained through any hack of Apple,\" an Apple spokesperson told Fortune in an email. \"There have not been any breaches in any of Apple's systems including iCloud and Apple ID.\" Even if the data didn't come from an Apple breach, it could still mean your iCloud login details are out there. Fortune suggested that the logins could be from the LinkedIn hack, in which login info from 117 million accounts was sold on the black market site \"The Real Deal.\" Though, if the Turkish Crime Family really has 559 million accounts, well, a mere fraction of the 117 million from LinkedIn doesn't really cut it. The hackers have been sending login information to media companies in an effort to gather attention to their scam. For example, The Next Web received a small fraction of the alleged data from the hackers, and cross-referenced the info with the site Have I Been Pwned, which checks to see if your email or username has been compromised in a hack. Most of the samples provided to TNW don't appear to have been involved in the LinkedIn hack or other hacks in the Pwned database, but TNW was able to access the accounts with the login information provided by the hackers, so the info looks legitimate. They can't test every login, so the small sample may not be indicative of the whole.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: shake down, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: accept, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: breached, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were not compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: hold, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was not obtained, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: hack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: hack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: been compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The Turkish Crime Family is, in fact, not contradicting Apple. They did not breach the company, nor did they ever state to Motherboard that they stole the info directly from Apple. Rather, after Motherboard's breaking March 21 report, a breach was assumed by some news outlets such as BGR, though most media sites never directly stated that the hackers breached Apple.

Medical and dental organizations have been advised to ensure FTP servers are configured to require users to be properly authenticated before access to stored data can be gained. Many FTP servers are configured to allow anonymous access using a common username such as \u2018FTP\u2019 or \u2018anonymous\u2019. In some cases, a generic password is required, although security researchers have discovered that in many cases, FTP servers can be accessed without a password. The FBI warning cites research conducted by the University of Michigan in 2015 that revealed more than 1 million FTP servers allowed anonymous access to stored data The FBI warns that hackers are targeting these anonymous FTP servers to gain access to the protected health information of patients. PHI carries a high value on the black market as it can be used for identity theft and fraud. Healthcare organizations could also be blackmailed if PHI is stolen. Last year, the hacker operating under the name TheDarkOverlord conducted a number of attacks on healthcare organizations. The protected health information of patients was stolen and organizations were threatened with the publication of data if a sizable ransom payment was not made. In some cases, patient data were published online when payment was not received. There are reasons why IT departments require FTP servers to accept anonymous requests; however, if that is the case, those servers should not be used to store any protected health information of patients. If PHI must be stored on the servers, they cannot be configured to run in anonymous mode. The FBI suggests all healthcare organizations should instruct their IT departments to check the configuration of their FTP servers to ensure they are not running in anonymous mode and to take immediate action to secure those servers and reduce risk if they are.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: warning, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: gain access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: be blackmailed, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: attacks, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransom payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payment was not received, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

As explained by mobile security firm Lookout (via Ars Technica), the scammers targeted iOS users viewing pornographic material and abused JavaScript pop-ups to create an endless pop-up loop that essentially locked the browser if the user didn't know how to bypass it.  Using \"scareware\" messages and posing as law enforcement, the scammers used the pop-ups to extort money in the form of iTunes gift cards from the victim, promising to unlock the browser for a sum of money.     The scammers abused the handling of pop-ups in Mobile Safari in such a way that a person would be \"locked\" out from using Safari unless they paid a fee or knew they could simply clear Safari's cache (see next section). The attack was contained within the app sandbox of the Safari browser; no exploit code was used in this campaign, unlike an advanced attack like Pegasus that breaks out of the app sandbox to install malware on the device.     The scammers registered domains and launched the attack from the domains they owned, such as police-pay[.]com, which the attackers apparently named with the intent of scaring users looking for certain types of material on the Internet into paying money.

Reports have also been filed with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Indiana State Police. Martin plans on contacting all employees affected about what they can do to protect themselves from unauthorized use of their personal information. No suspect information has been released at this time. CEO Scott Wise released a statement saying: \"Unfortunately, Scotty's was the target of and fell victim to scammers, as so many other companies have.

That's according to our news reporting partners at CBS4 Indy. Company officials called police about the leak Monday afternoon. Somebody posing as CEO Scott Wise emailed a payroll employee, asking her to send all 4,000 W-2 forms to him. The e-mail wasn\u2019t really from Wise, but the employee did send all the forms, giving the scammer personal finance information for all those employees. Scotty\u2019s Brewhouse executives contacted the IRS and Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department about the breach. They\u2019re now working to notify all their employees and give them steps to protect their financial information. IMPD and other agencies are involved in the investigation into who sent the bogus email. This email scam matches a phishing scheme that prompted a warning from the IRS last year during tax season. At that time, the agency recorded a 400 percent increase in this kind of scam. The IRS has a website to use if your W-2 or other information has been leaked. Tuesday evening, Scotty's Brewhouse issued a statement on the situation: Yesterday Scotty\u2019s Holdings, LLC and its subsidiary, affiliate and managed entities were the victims of an email phishing scam that resulted in the disclosure of 2016 W-2 information. Scotty\u2019s has confirmed that no customer information was obtained by the scammers in yesterday\u2019s phishing scam. Scotty\u2019s is working closely with federal and local law enforcement and the credit bureaus to limit any potential misuse of the information that was obtained and to identify and apprehend the scammers. \u201cUnfortunately, Scotty\u2019s was the target of and fell victim to scammers, as so many other companies have,\u201d said Scott Wise, CEO of Scotty\u2019s Holdings, LLC. \u201cScotty\u2019s employees and customers are of tremendous importance to the company and Scotty\u2019s regrets any inconvenience to its employees that may result from this scamming incident.

It did not specific what type of encryption was used. It also did not say how many voters might be affected, but Channel News Asia reported that Hong Kong has 3.7 million registered voters. Hong Kong's Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data has launched an investigation.  On March 26, the Election Committee picked Carrie Lam as the first female chief executive of Hong Kong, which is formally known as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China. The election happens every five years. The laptops were part of a backup system for the election. REO says the room, in Hall 7 of the AsiaWorld Expo, was monitored by closed-circuit television. The South China Morning Post reported that the door to the room was locked and required both a passcode and an access card for entry. It doesn't appear the door was forced open. An anonymous source told the SCMP that the computers themselves were not expensive, leading investigators to believe that the equipment may have been intentionally targeted. The laptops were left in the storeroom on March 22 and were still there two days later. The theft was discovered on March 27.

TUEs are special exemptions given to athletes that allow them to take otherwise banned substances if they have a specific medical need. A statement on the IAAF website said: \"The presence of unauthorized remote access to the IAAF network by the attackers was noted on 21 February where meta data on athlete TUEs was collected from a file server and stored in a newly created file.\" While the IAAF did not know if that data was eventually taken, it said there was \u201ca strong indication of the attackers\u2019 interest and intent.\u201d Fancy Bear was responsible for a hack that targeted the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) last year, subsequently revealing what it said were TUEs granted to a host of U.S. Olympics stars.

U.S. officials have also previously linked Fancy Bear to GRU, the Russian military intelligence agency. However, Russian officials denied playing any role in the various hacks attributed to Fancy Bear. The IAAF said athletes who have applied for TUEs since 2012 have been contacted.

A Chinese hacking group with advanced cyber-espionage capabilities has been targeting managed IT services providers across the globe in a campaign to steal sensitive data. The cybercriminal gang is using sophisticated phishing attacks and customised malware in order to infect victims' machines and then gain access to IT providers and their customer networks. Dubbed Operation Cloud Hopper, the cyber-espionage campaign has been uncovered by security researchers at PwC, BAE Systems, and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre. The researchers say the campaign is \"highly likely\" to be the work of the China-based APT10 hacking group. The group has been focusing on espionage since 2009 and has evolved from targeting US defence firms as well as the technology and telecommunications sectors to targeting organisations in multiple industries across the globe. The group was behind the Poison Ivy malware family and has evolved its operations to include using custom tools capable of compromising high volumes of data from organisations and their customers, and stealthily moving it around the world. It's because of the sophisticated nature of the campaign that PwC's Operation Cloud Hopper report describes how APT10 \"almost certainly benefits from significant staffing and logistical resources, which have increased over the last three years\". The group's work shifted significantly during 2016, as it started to focus on managed service providers, following the significant enhancements to its operations. The move enabled APT10 to exfiltrate data from multiple victims around the world as part of a large scale campaign. Managed service providers (MSPs) represent a particularly lucrative target for attackers, because as well as having access to their clients' networks, they also store significant quantities of customer data, which can provide useful information or be sold for profit. Researchers note that the spear phishing campaign undertaken by APT10 indicates that the group conducts significant research on targets, in order to have the best chance of tricking them into opening malicious documents attached to specially crafted emails. Once the hacking group has infiltrated a network, it conducts reconnaissance to ensure legitimate credentials have been gained, before deploying tools such as mimikatz or PwDump to steal additional credentials, administration credentials, and data from infected MSPs.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: compromising, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exfiltrate, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: having access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the spear phishing campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: tricking, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: have been gained, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

A Chinese hacking group is thought to be behind attacks on managed service providers as a way into their client companies, to facilitate the theft of intellectual property. The hacking group, called APT10, used custom malware and spear-phishing attacks to gain access to victims' systems. Once inside, they used the company's credentials to attack their client companies. The security of the supply chain has been a recognised weakness in security systems since at least 2013 when it was discovered that attackers had gained access to the Target retail chain in America through an HVAC service provider. Now it appears that APT10 is using that approach on a large scale. The group was discovered by PwC's cyber-security practice and BAE Systems, working alongside the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). The scale of the espionage campaign only became apparent in late 2016, but the attack is thought to be the largest sustained global cyber-espionage campaign ever seen.  PwC and BAE Systems said APT10 conducted the espionage campaign by targeting providers of managed outsourced IT services as a way in to their customers' organisations around the world, gaining unprecedented access to intellectual property and sensitive data. It is thought the group launched the campaign in 2014 and then significantly ramped it up in early 2016, adding new developers and intrusion operators to continually enhance capability. The group is known to have exfiltrated a high volume of data from multiple victims and used compromised networks to stealthily move this data around the world. A number of Japanese organisations have also been targeted directly in a separate, simultaneous campaign by the same group, with APT10 masquerading as legitimate Japanese government entities to gain access. Forensic analysis of the timings of the attack, as well as tools and techniques used, led investigators to conclude that the group may be based in China, but apart from that, it is not known precisely who is behind APT10 or why it targets certain organisations. Kris McConkey, partner for cyber-threat detection and response at PwC, said that the  indirect approach of this attack highlights the need for organisations to have a comprehensive view of the threats they're exposed to \u2013 including those of their supply chain.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: spear-phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: have exfiltrated, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: masquerading as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Richard Horne, cyber-security partner at PwC, added that \u201coperating alone, none of us would have joined the dots to uncover this new campaign of indirect attacks. \u201cTogether we've been working to brief the global security community, managed service providers and known end victims to help prevent, detect and respond to these attacks,\u201d he added.   Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of High-Tech Bridge, told SC Media UK that until there is more detail on the attacks, it would not be possible to make a reliable conclusion as to who was behind the so-called APT10. \u201cTaking into consideration how careless and negligent some managed IT providers are, I wouldn't be surprised if all the attacks were conducted by a group of teenagers \u2013 something we have already seen in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cIT services providers should better enumerate and assess their digital risks, and implement appropriate security controls to mitigate related threats and vulnerabilities. Security standards, like ISO 27001, can significantly help assure that the risks are continuously identified and are being duly addressed. For cyber-security service providers, accreditation by CREST is also an important factor to demonstrate the necessary standard of care around security, confidentiality and integrity for their own and client data,\u201d he added. \u201cCompanies looking to secure their supply-chain can oblige their suppliers to get certified by ISO 27001 for example, or to provide solid and unconditional insurance to cover any data breaches and data leaks, including direct and consequent damages.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data leaks, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The attacks were found to have breached a wide variety of secret data ranging from personal data to intellectual property, in what the report described as \"one of the largest ever sustained global cyber espionage campaigns\". The group behind the attacks, named APT10, was found to have used custom malware and \"spear phishing\" techniques to target managed outsourced IT service companies as stepping stones into the systems of an \"unprecedented web\" of victims according to the report's authors. The report's authors included the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and cyber units at defence group BAE systems and accountancy firm PwC. The gang were found to have used the companies as a way into their customers' systems from 2016 onwards, although there is evidence to suggest they had first employed the tactics from as early 2014. PwC cyber security Partner Richard Horne told the Press Association the extent of the malicious campaign was still unclear. He said: \"The reason we've gone public with this is because we can see so much and we have seen so much in several managed IT service providers (MSPs) and other companies compromised through it, but we don't know how far this has gone. \"Us, together with the NCSC and BAE Systems are very keen to get this information out there so we can promote a mass response to this.\" The report behind the unmasking operation, codenamed Cloud Hopper, highlights targeted attacks against Japanese commercial firms and public bodies, but indicates further widespread operations against companies in 14 other countries including the UK, France and the United States. The report's authors state APT10 is \"highly likely\" to be based in China, demonstrating a pattern of work in line with China Standard Time (UTC+8) and the targeting of specific commercial enterprises \"closely aligned with strategic Chinese interests\". Mr Horne said the data collected in individual attacks spanned a plethora of sensitive categorisations. He said: \"We've seen a number of different companies targeted for different reasons, but essentially it's all around sensitive information they hold, whether that's intellectual property, or personal information on people or a whole realm of other areas.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: The attacks, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: have breached, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: spear phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: the data collected, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

However, because hackers may have accessed portions of the practice\u2019s network, the pediatrics group is offering identity and credit protection services from Equifax Personal Solutions to all of its patients. The pediatrics group, which has four locations, posted a \u201cHIPAA Notification\u201d on its website, regarding an incident that may have affected patients\u2019 protected health information (PHI). The practice stated that the notice was made in compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Prior to the attack, ABCD Pediatrics had a variety of security measures in place, including network filtering and security monitoring, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, antivirus software, and password protection, according to the organization\u2019s statement. On February 6, 2017, an employee of ABCD Pediatrics discovered that a virus gained access and began encrypting ABCD\u2019s servers. The encryption was slowed significantly by existing antivirus software. Upon discovery, ABCD immediately contacted its IT vendor, and ABCD\u2019s servers and computers were promptly moved offline and analyzed. The virus was identified as \u201cDharma Ransomware,\u201d which is a variant of an older ransomware virus called \u201cCriSiS,\u201d according to the organization\u2019s IT vendor. \u201cABCD\u2019s IT company reported that these virus strains typically do not exfiltrate (\u201cremove\u201d) data from the server; however, exfiltration could not be ruled out.

The breach may be the most extensive since 2015, when thieves gained access to the tax returns of over 300,000 people by using stolen data and filed fraudulent returns to get refunds. The possibility of an attack became known in early March after the I.R.S. shut down its Data Retrieval Tool, which families used to import tax information to Fafsa, the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, on the Education Department\u2019s website. The shutdown, at the height of financial aid application season, caused outrage among parents and students trying to fill out the complicated Fafsa forms. The I.R.S. has been struggling to overhaul its defenses against increasingly sophisticated cyberthreats as its budget shrinks and its staff dwindles. The agency became concerned last fall when it realized that it was possible for criminals to take advantage of the student loan tool that allows aid applicants to automatically populate the applications with their and their parents\u2019 tax information. The worry was that thieves might use the stolen data to file fraudulent returns and steal refunds, as they did two years ago. \u201cFortunately we caught this at the front end,\u201d John Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner, said Thursday at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. The I.R.S. does not expect the tool to be secure and operational again until October. \u201cOur highest priority is making sure that we protect taxpayers and their identity,\u201d he said. But the breadth of the breach remains unknown, and Mr. Koskinen faced tough questions during the hearing as to why he did not act sooner. Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the committee, wondered why Mr. Koskinen had waited several months to shut down the tool after realizing that it might be vulnerable. Mr. Koskinen said he did not want to cut off a tool that millions of financial aid applicants use before the evidence of foul play was clear. After monitoring activity in the system, the I.R.S. noticed an unusual spike of unfinished applications in February that suggested criminals were at work.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have been compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: posed as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: gained access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The agency believes that fewer than 8,000 fraudulent returns were filed and processed, resulting in refunds issued.

Research published by cybersecurity firm F-Secure suggested the attack was a \u201cspear-phishing\u201d campaign in which people are sent targeted emails with a link to a false login page to trick users into giving up their username and password.  The hackers created websites that looked like legitimate Foreign Office websites, including those for accessing an internal email account online. The scam is believed to have been perpetrated by hackers who call themselves the Callisto Group.  F-Secure said it did not know whether the attack was successful and the National Cyber Security Centre did not say whether data had been stolen. It was discovered after the spy agency analysed a successful attack on the French broadcaster TV5Monde in 2015.

Stuart Kettell \u2212 owner of audio-visual specialist Kettell Video Productions \u2212 was targeted by tech scammers who infiltrated his firm\u2019s IT systems with malware that infected its network of files.

And the demand for payment seemed very professional: I was given links where I could buy Bitcoins and even offered the chance to decrypt one file for free!  \u201cI unplugged my computer, isolated it from the internet, and ran some anti-malware software to stop the virus spreading further.  \u201cIt was scary: I had no idea about cyber-attacks before and really didn\u2019t know what to do. Critical files, including images and videos for clients, were wiped out along with a lifetime of personal memories. \u201cThe affected files were lost for good \u2212 the only way to recover them was with the key code held by the blackmailer \u2212 but luckily I back-up everything to an external data cartridge.

The employee responded quickly as requested, not realizing the W-2 forms \u2014 containing the addresses, social security numbers, and salary information for Sunrun's nearly 4,000 employees \u2014 were actually being delivered to a scam artist. Tax season is always a busy time for scammers seeking to gain access to sensitive information,  but this year attacks are coming earlier and in greater numbers than usual. The uptick has caused the IRS to release an urgent alert warning employers to be on the lookout for what they're refering to as \"one of the most dangerous email phishing scams we\u2019ve seen in a long time.\" By using email spoofing techniques, criminals are able to draft emails that look as though they are coming directly from a high-level executive at your organization. They send the message to an employee in the payroll department or HR and include a request for a list of the organization's employees along with their W-2 forms. Their initial goal is to use the W-2 information to file fraudulent tax returns and claim refunds. But not all criminals are stopping there. Once they've found a responsive victim, a portion are also following up with additional email requesting a wire transfer be made to an account they provide.

Fraudsters are gaining access to Office 365 accounts by stealing login credentials obtained using convincing fake login screens. Fraudster email attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated \u2013 often appearing to be sent from a business, organization, or individual the victim normally emails or does business with. The fictitious emails contain malicious links or attachments that redirect the victim to a fake login page asking for their email username and password. Once the information is entered, fraudsters then use the stolen credentials to log into Office 365 and send fraudulent emails to the victim\u2019s contact list, perpetuating the scam. If you use Office 365 for email, we encourage you to be extra vigilant. Emails containing hyperlinks or attachments that require additional actions by you should be carefully vetted before proceeding. If you are unsure if an email you received is legitimate, do not click on any links, attachments, or provide any information. We also encourage you to contact any of your email contacts via phone or a safe email address to inform them that your email account has been compromised and to let them know they may receive fraudulent emails appearing to be sent by you. While Office 365 is the most recent phishing target, these types of scams regularly impact other email applications and platforms as well. Always be cautious when opening any emails that were not expected, are coming from someone you do not know, and contain links or attachments you were not expecting.

A Chrome browser update, which has been rolling out since February, now issues a warning when you've landed on an page with the scam. In your browser address bar, look out for \"not secure\" to the left of the address. Fortune reports that in the future, Google will present this warning and indicate unprotected sites more aggressively with a red triangle. According to Satnam Narang, Senior Security Response Manager at Norton by Symantec, here's how the Gmail phishing scam works: You'll see an email in your inbox from one of your contacts who has already been hacked. The email looks like it contains an attachment. But if you look closely, as this Twitter user did, you'll notice that the image preview for the attachment looks slightly fuzzy. This is because there isn't actually an attachment, just an image designed to look like one. If you click on the image you'll be directed to a page that looks like the standard Google sign-in page. If you log-in there, the damage is done: The hacker can read and download all of your emails and could also access accounts elsewhere. In the past, you might have recognized a scam by the language in the email. But Narang says that there are reports that these hackers are sending emails that look realistic. In one school district, for example, team members received what looked like a copy of a practice schedule. Still, there are things you can look out for to spot a fake. \"The best way to identify this attack is to look at the address bar. In this case, look for the words 'data:/text/html' at the beginning of the URL,\" Narang says. \"If you see this, close the browser tab and alert your friend that their account has been compromised.\" Narang also recommends setting up two-step verification for your Gmail account (find out how to do so here). And follow these rules for boosting your password strength.

The scam emails will spoof a request from the organization\u2019s CEO (or someone similarly high up in the organization) and request all employee W-2 forms. Defense Point did not return calls or emails seeking comment. An Accenture spokesperson issued the following brief statement:  \u201cData protection and our employees are top priorities. Our leadership and security team are providing support to all impacted employees.\u201d Fraudsters who perpetrate tax refund fraud prize W-2 information because it contains virtually all of the data one would need to fraudulently file someone\u2019s taxes and request a large refund in their name.

In a report published April 27, Fortune disclosed the identities of both companies. The companies had been tricked into wiring over US$100 million to the alleged scammer\u2019s bank accounts. Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, purportedly posed as an Asia-based manufacturer and deceived the two companies from at least 2013 to 2015. \"Fraudulent phishing emails were sent to employees and agents of the victim companies, which regularly conducted multimillion-dollar transactions with [the Asian] company,\" the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said. The DOJ alleged that emails supposedly from the employees of said Asian manufacturer were sent from email accounts designed to look like they were actually from the firm. Rimasauskas was charged by the DOJ in March of sending the forged emails, as well as for fabricating invoices, contracts and letters \"that falsely appeared to have been executed and signed by executives and agents of the victim companies.\" \"We detected this fraud against our vendor management team and promptly alerted the authorities,\" a spokesperson for Google said in a statement. \"We recouped the funds and we're pleased this matter is resolved.\" \"Facebook recovered the bulk of the funds shortly after the incident and has been cooperating with law enforcement in its investigation,\" a representative from Facebook said. The BBC reported that neither Google nor Facebook revealed how much money they had transferred, or how much they recouped following the incident. While the two companies have advanced cybersecurity measures in place, the phishing attacks targeted individuals through their emails \u2014 attacks that could have been avoided through proper verification of dubious payment requests. \"Sometimes staff [at large firms] think that they are defended, that security isn't part of their job,\" James Maude of cyber-security firm Avecto told the BBC. \"But people are part of the best security you can have \u2014 that's why you have to train them.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: an email phishing scam attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: had been tricked, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: purportedly posed as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: deceived, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were sent to, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were sent from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: designed to look like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: falsely appeared, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: the phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

A spokesman for the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency refused to comment Wednesday on the authenticity of the 8,771 documents, but argued there could be little doubt about WikiLeaks' intentions \"to damage the Intelligence Community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries.\" \"Such disclosures not only jeopardize U.S. personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm,\" CIA spokesman Jonathan Liu said in a statement. White House press secretary Sean Spicer also expressed alarm Wednesday, telling reporters the U.S. \"will go after people who leak classified information.\" \"This is the kind of disclosure that undermines our security, our country and our well-being,\" he told reporters, adding President Donald Trump is \"extremely concerned.\" Review of documents Like the CIA, Spicer refused to confirm the authenticity of the WikiLeaks documents. But several cybersecurity experts and former intelligence officials who reviewed them told VOA that they appeared to be real. WikiLeaks said it obtained the documents from a former U.S. government hacker. And a U.S. intelligence official told VOA, on condition of anonymity, that it appeared a CIA contractor might have been the source. \"There's always someone with the permissions to do this sort of thing,\" said Alex McGeorge, the head of Threat Intelligence at Immunity Inc., a cyber firm that does some work with government agencies. McGeorge also said that while the disclosures were damaging, WikiLeaks' claim that the documents dump represented the CIA's \"entire hacking capacity\" was most likely overblown. \"What we currently have in this dump doesn't provide a whole lot,\" he said. Many of the WikiLeaks documents appeared to be online transcripts of conversations between intelligence agency employees working to exploit software to turn digital devices \u2014 such as mobile phones like Apple or Android smartphones, or even Samsung's smart televisions \u2014 into listening devices.

Evaldas Rimasauskas, 48, was arrested late last week by Lithuanian authorities, Manhattan federal prosecutors said on Tuesday. Rimasauskas does not yet have legal counsel, a spokesman for the prosecutors said. The alleged scheme is an example of a growing type of fraud called \u201cbusiness email compromise\u201d, in which fraudsters ask for money using emails targeted at companies that work with foreign suppliers or regularly make wire transfers. It is a variation on the common \u201cphishing\u201d scam, but on a massive scale. The FBI said last June that since October 2013, US and foreign victims have made 22,143 complaints about business email compromise scams involving requests for almost US$3.1 billion in transfers. In an indictment unsealed on Tuesday, prosecutors said that to carry out his scheme, which they said began around 2013 or earlier, Rimasauskas registered a company in Latvia with the same name as an Asian computer hardware manufacturer. He then sent emails to employees of the two unnamed victim companies, described as multinational internet firms, asking them to wire money that they actually owed to the Asian company to the sham Latvian company\u2019s accounts, prosecutors said. The victim companies are described as a multinational technology company and a multinational social media company. After they wired money to Rimasauskas\u2019s Latvian company, Rimasauskas quickly transferred the funds to different accounts around the world, including in Latvia, Cyprus, Slovakia, Lithuania, Hungary and Hong Kong, prosecutors said. In order to conceal his fraud from banks that handled the transfers, Rimasauskas forged invoices, contracts and letters purportedly signed by executives at the two victim companies, according to prosecutors. Rimasauskas is charged with wire fraud and money laundering, which each carry a maximum prison sentence of 20 years, and identify theft, which carries a mandatory minimum sentence of two years. Acting US Attorney Joon H. Kim said: \u201cFrom half a world away, Evaldas Rimasauskas allegedly targeted multinational internet companies and tricked their agents and employees into wiring over US$100 million to overseas bank accounts under his control.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: bilked, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: posing as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: business email compromise, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: \u201cphishing\u201d scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: business email compromise scams, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: described as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: are described as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: forged, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: tricked, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

We regret, however, that information about some of our patients may have been accessed by an unauthorized third party due to an email \u201cphishing\u201d incident. On January 24, 2017, the medical school learned that some of its employees responded to a Dec 2, 2016, \u201cphishing\u201d email, believing it to be a legitimate request. A \u201cphishing\u201d email is designed to look like a legitimate email but tricks the recipient into taking some action, such as providing login credentials. Upon learning of the incident, we secured the email accounts and began an investigation. The investigation could not rule out that an unauthorized third party may have gained access to some employees\u2019 email accounts. We conducted a detailed review of the employees\u2019 email accounts and confirmed that some of the emails contained patient information, which may have included names, birth dates, medical record numbers, diagnosis and treatment information, other clinical information, and in some instances Social Security numbers. We reported the phishing incident to law enforcement and are cooperating with the investigation. We have no indication that the information in the emails has been misused. However, as a precaution, we began mailing letters to affected patients on March 24, 2017, and have established a dedicated call center to answer any questions patients may have. If you believe you may be affected and have not received a letter by April 24, 2017, or if you have any questions regarding this incident, please call 844-641-5630. The call center is open Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. central time. We regret any inconvenience this incident may have caused our patients. To help prevent such incidents in the future, we are reinforcing education with our staff and faculty of existing protocols and university resources regarding \u201cphishing\u201d emails.

As employees walked into city hall for work, they were handed a printed notice telling them to not use their computers until they were cleared by the municipal IT group, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. At a news conference Friday afternoon, Atlanta chief operating officer Richard Cox said that the WiFi at Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport had been disabled out of \"an abundance of caution.\" The city is still working on mitigating the ransomware and Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms did not answer questions from reporters as to whether the attack had ended. \"What we want to make sure of is that we aren\u2019t putting a Band-Aid on a gaping wound. We want to make sure that we take the appropriate steps,\" she said. Atlanta doesn\u2019t know who is behind the attack, the mayor said. The good news is that while \u201cthis is a massive inconvenience to the city, it is not life and death,\u201d she said. Police, fire and other vital services are still fully functional, Cox said.  The attack hit early Thursday morning. Bottoms has repeatedly told employees they should monitor their bank accounts because city officials don\u2019t yet know what information was compromised in the attack. \"Let's just assume that if your personal information is housed by the City of Atlanta, whether it be because you are a customer who goes online and pays your bills or any employee or even a retiree, we don't know the extent, so we just ask that you be vigilant,\" Bottoms said. The ransomware is affecting applications that customers use to pay bills and access court-related information among other things, Bottoms said. The attackers demanded the equivalent of $51,000 in digital currency to unlock the system.  The city is working with the FBI and local law enforcement to investigate the attack, Cox said. While it has been a difficult two days, Atlanta will in the end prevail, he said. \"The city was around before computers were around, said Cox. \"We\u2019ll rise from the ashes,\" he added[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Hackers are seeking a whole lot of money to return control of the network to its rightful owners. The importance of great network security cannot be overstated. Officials in Licking County have learned this lesson the hard way, as hackers have installed a computer virus, known as \u2018ransomware,' that has locked up the local government's entire network, including that of the police force. Emergency services are still working, however. \"You lose your computers, the world changes a little bit,\" remarked Licking County commissioner Tim Bubb. Apparently, someone in the office downloaded the malware by clicking on a link in a phishing email, or just downloaded the virus from some malicious website. Ransomware is a type of computer virus that encrypts data on a user's computer, making it inaccessible. The ransomware then displays a message onscreen, ordinarily demanding money and providing a sole text input field in which a user must enter an unlock code provided by the malefactor, after the money is paid. \"All county offices remain open, but online access and landline telephones are not available for those on the county system. The shutdown is expected to continue at least the rest of the week,\" according to the Newark Advocate news website. According to Bubb, the 911 office, due to budget restrictions, had not shifted to an online-accessible network, and so was working in normal capacity. \"Because they're working manually, they have made the staff a little more robust,\" he said. He underscored that people can call 911, and that every emergency call is answered and responded to, using paper, printed maps, dry-erase boards and was dispatching first responders with old-fashioned radios. \"People of Licking County, we believe, are protected as they always are with 911,\" he added, according to WCMH-TV. The amount of ransom demanded by the hackers remains undisclosed, as well as whether the ransom will be paid. \"We're dealing with a criminal element. It's a crime against the people of Licking County and its government.\" Bubb said, adding that the county government currently is seeking the assistance of cybersecurity experts.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: are seeking a whole lot of money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the money is paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom will be paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

According to breach detection firm GuardiCore, the attacks are happening via brute-force attacks on Internet-exposed MySQL servers, and there's plenty of those laying around since MySQL is one of today's most popular database systems. All attacks came from a server in the Netherlands Based on currently available evidence, the attacks started on February 12, and only lasted for 30 hours, during which time attackers attempted to brute-force their way into MySQL root accounts. Investigators said all attacks came from the same IP address from the Netherlands, 109.236.88.20, belonging to a hosting company called WorldStream. During their ransacking, attackers didn't behave in a constant pattern, making it hard to attribute the hacks to one group, despite the usage of the same IP. For example, after gaining access to MySQL servers, attackers created a new database called PLEASE_READ and left a table inside it called WARNING that contained their ransom demands. In some cases, attackers only created the WARNING table and left it inside an already existing database, without creating a new one. Investigators report that attackers would then dump the database's content and delete it afterward, leaving only the one holding their ransom. In some cases, attackers deleted the databases without dumping any data. Attackers have their own website Two ransom notes have been found in the hundreds of confirmed attacks, one asking victims to get in contact via email and confirm the payment, while the other used a completely different mode of operation, redirecting users to a Tor-hosted website. The two Bitcoin addresses listed in the ransom notes received four and six payments, respectively, albeit GuardiCore experts doubt that all are from victims. \"We can not tell whether it was the attackers who made the transactions to make their victims feel more confident about paying,\" they said. Be sure the attacker still has your data Just like in the case of the now infamous MongoDB attacks that have hit over 41,000 servers, it's recommended that victims check logs before deciding to pay and see if the attackers actually took their data.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: the ransacking, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: asking for, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: their ransacking, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: their ransom demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: holding their ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: asking, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: MongoDB attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: have hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

A popup is displayed advising the user that Safari cannot open the requested page. Clicking on OK to close the message triggers another popup warning. Safari is then locked in an endless loop of popup messages that cannot be closed.

Some users have reported messages containing Interpol banners, which are intended to make the user think the lock has been put on their phone by law enforcement. The only way of unlocking the device, according to the messages, is to pay a fine. One of the domains used by the attackers is police-pay.com; however, few users would likely be fooled into thinking the browser lock was implemented by a police department as the fine had to be paid in the form of an iTunes gift card.

Dubbed Sanctions Ransomware due to the image in the ransom note, the developer makes it fairly obvious how they feel about the USA and their attempts to sanction Russia. I was tipped off about this new ransomware after someone was infected and had their files encrypted with the .wallet extension.

This equates to about $6,500 USD at bitcoin's current rate.  As this is a very large ransom payment and due to the fact that this ransomware is not in wide circulation, it leads me to believe that this ransomware developer may be conducting targeted attacks.

The attacker asked for $400 to unlock the company's systems, but the victim refused and instead recovered its data via older backups. Attack traced back to Linz teenager The company filed a criminal complaint with the Austrian Federal Criminal Police Office (Bundeskriminalamt, or BK), claiming damages of \u20ac3,000 due to production losses. An investigation by Austrian police's SOKO Clavis unit tracked down the attack to a Linz teenager. Authorities searched the suspect's homes, one in Linz, and one near Vienna, where he moved. Police arrested the young man, who was later released and is now under an official investigation. According to a BK spokesperson, the teenager denied all accusations. Teenager bought ransomware off the Dark Web Investigators believe the suspect bought the Philadelphia ransomware off the Dark Web. The ransomware is currently on sale on the AlphaBay Dark Web marketplace starting with $389. The ransomware appeared in September 2016 and was based on the Stampado ransomware. Emsisoft released a free decrypter for Philadelphia a day after the ransomware first appeared. According to a Forcepoint report published today, Philadelphia is also the tool of choice for ransomware attacks against the healthcare sector. Austrian police are also investigating (cached mirror) another ransomware attack that targeted an Austrian hotel. In late January, a ransomware attack at an Austrian hotel affected the electronic door locking system at an Austrian hotel.

For their attacks, the groups are using a zero-day in Apache Struts, disclosed and immediately fixed last month by Apache. The vulnerability, CVE-2017-5638, allows an attacker to execute commands on the server via content uploaded to the Jakarta Multipart parser component, deployed in some Struts installations. Attackers initially focused on Linux server. According to cyber-security firms F5, attacks started as soon as Cisco Talos researchers revealed the zero-day's presence and several proof-of-concept exploits were published online. Since early March, attacks have slowly evolved. F5 experts say that in the beginning, attackers targeted Struts instances running on Linux servers, where they would end up installing the PowerBot malware, an IRC-controlled DDoS bot also known as PerlBot or Shellbot. In later attacks, some groups switched to installing a cryptocurrency miner called \"minerd\" that mined for the Monero cryptocurrency. In other attacks reported by the SANS Technology Institute, some attackers installed Perl backdoors. Recent attacks also targeted Struts running on Windows Both SANS and F5 experts report that after March 20, one of these groups switched to targeting Struts instances installed on Windows systems. Using a slightly modified exploit code, attackers executed various shell commands to run the BITSAdmin utility and then downloaded (via Windows' built-in FTP support) the Cerber ransomware. From this point on, Cerber took over, encrypted files, and displayed its standard ransom note, leaving victims no choice but pay the ransom demand or recover data from backups. \"The attackers running this [Cerber] campaign are using the same Bitcoin ID for a number of campaigns,\" the F5 team said. \"This particular account has processed 84 bitcoins [~$100,000].\" F5 experts also noted that, on average, roughly 2.2 Bitcoin (~$2,600) go in and out of this particular wallet on a daily basis. The most recent payments dates to today. It is worth mentioning that F5 published their findings last week, on March 29.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: pay the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

On Friday, those countdowns begin reaching zero. But as of lunchtime the attackers had claimed only about $92,000 (\u20ac82,183) in payments from their widespread ransom demands, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd, a UK-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculates the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands. The ransomware, called WannaCry, began infecting users on May 12th and gave them 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin or pay twice as much. Refusal to pay after seven days was promised to result in the permanent loss of data via irrevocable encryption. With affected institutions including the Health Service Executive (which said it prevented the ransomware from activating), the National Health Service in the UK, FedEx and PetroChina, few initially paid up, leading to speculation that organisations were taking their chances on fixing their corrupt machines before the ransom forced a mass deletion of critical data. A week later, experts agree the financial gains of the hackers remain astonishingly low. \u201cWith over 200,000 machines affected, the figure is lower than expected,\u201d said Jamie Akhtar, co-founder of the London-based security software firm CyberSmart. \u201cIf even 1 per cent paid the ransom that would be $600k.\u201d Mr Akhtar said experts may never know how much larger this figure would have been if a so-called kill switch had not been accidentally triggered by a cyber security researcher, who registered an internet domain that acted as a disabling tool for the worm\u2019s propagation. While the world\u2019s law enforcement is pointing its resources at trying to identify the culprits, Tom Robinson, chief operating officer and co-founder of Elliptic Enterprises, says it\u2019s unlikely the money taken from victims will be taken from the digital bitcoin wallets they\u2019re being anonymously held in. \u201cGiven the amount of scrutiny this has come under, I would be surprised if they moved it anytime soon,\u201d he said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a global cyberattack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid up, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Almost three months on from the WannaCry ransomware outbreak, those behind the global cyberattack have finally cashed out their ransom payments. The WannaCry epidemic hit organisations around the world in May, with the file-encrypting malware -- which used a leaked NSA exploit -- attacking Windows systems. It infected over 300,000 PCs and crippling systems across the Americas, Europe, Russia, and China.  The UK's National Health Service was particularly badly hit by the attack, with hospitals and doctor's surgeries knocked offline, and some services not restored until days after the ransomware hit. WannaCry continued to claim victims even after the initial outbreak: June saw Honda forced to shut down a factory due to an infection and speed cameras in Victoria, Australia also fell victim to the ransomware. While the attack was certainly high profile, mistakes in the code meant many victims of WannaCry were able to successfully unlock systems without giving into the demands of hackers. A bot tracking ransom payments says only 338 victims paid the $300 bitcoin ransom demand - not exactly a large haul for an attack which infected hundreds of thousands of computers. In the months since the attack, the bitcoin wallets containing the money extorted by WannaCry were left untouched, but August 3 saw them suddenly start to be emptied. At the time of withdrawal, the value of the wallets totalled $140,000 thanks to changes in the valuation of bitcoin. Three separate withdrawals between 7.3 bitcoin ($20,055) and 9.67 bitcoin ($26,435) were made in the space of a minute at 4:10am BST, accounting for around half of the total value of the extorted funds. Five minutes later, three more withdrawals of between seven bitcoin ($19.318) and 10 Bitcoin ($27,514) were made in the space of another 60 seconds. Ten minutes later, a final withdrawal was made, emptying the remaining bitcoin from the WannaCry wallets. There's no official confirmation of who carried out the attack, but both private cybersecurity firms and investigating government agencies have pointed to North Korea as the culprit.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: WannaCry cyberattack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid ransoms, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the WannaCry ransomware outbreak, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the global cyberattack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: their ransom payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The WannaCry epidemic hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: attacking, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransomware hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: WannaCry, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: money extorted, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

However, from the viewpoint of a private citizen whose entire database has been held hostage by vicious hackers, not paying a ransom is hardly an option. According to the FBI\u2019s own statistics, ransomware attacks are spreading like virus in the US alone, with a spike as alarming as $209 million in damages in the first three months of 2016. When you look at it, the reasons behind the spread of ransomware are quite easy to understand. The malicious coding can be acquired by anyone with an internet connection for as little as a hundred dollars on the Deep Web, the psychological pressure over losing one\u2019s important data almost always ends up in a successful heist and the current law enforcement system can and does very little to prevent the situation from going out of control. That, however, is not to say that the law enforcement isn\u2019t concerned. In a news report released in April 2016, the FBI expressed its direct concerns over the unchallenged growth of ransomware attacks and urged any victims to not give in to the demand for ransom unless all other options are exhausted. Unfortunately, however, as is the case with most ransomware attacks, the stakes of losing years worth of important data is always quite high and the ransom demanded usually very small,  leading most victims to give in to the attackers\u2019 demands before even reaching out to law enforcement. For starters, though, let\u2019s try and have a look at what ransomware is, and what differentiates it from other types of malicious coding. The most common form of ransomware is one that infiltrates your network, gains access to your data and encrypts them using advanced algorithms to prevent you from accessing your own files. A demand for an aggressive amount of money, generally in Bitcoin, is then demanded by the perpetrator in exchange for the key that decrypts said data that has been hijacked. There are, of course, several other types of ransomware, such as the kind that block access to the entire operating system or the kind that attaches itself to a partition of the computer\u2019s hard drive. Most ransomware come with some sort of encryption key that is used to unlock the stolen data files once ransom is paid, though there is absolutely no guarantee that the perpetrator will keep their end of the bargain once money is transferred.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: paying a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the demand for ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: gains access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: A demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: is then demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom is paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Ransomware attacks also feature a time limit to add an element of psychological pressure against the victim, after which the data in concern is either stolen or deleted from the victim\u2019s servers permanently. Attackers these days almost always ask for payment in Bitcoin, as the cryptocurrency is incredibly difficult to track as far as payments go. The concern over ransomware lies not in individual cases but the number of cases reported each year, which makes it the most popular cyber-infiltration scenario in current times. According to the Cyber Threat Alliance (CTA), the damages caused by CryptoWall 3, a particular type of ransomware, hit $325 million in 2015 alone. As per statistics produced by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the first few months of 2016, a single variant of ransomware infected as many as 100,000 computers each day. In the March of 2016, the number of computers infected by ransomware technology hit the absolute upper ceiling for the year, reports Symantec.

The value of bitcoin has soared in recent days: at the one point the cryptocurrency was worth almost $19,000 before it dropped back to around $16,500, where it has roughly remained since. It's almost impossible to predict what will happen next. The price of bitcoin could rise again or it could crash -- but, for now at least, a single unit of the cryptocurrency is worth a significant amount of money. Bitcoin has become the popular payment method for ransomware over the last two years, as the digital currency provides cybercriminals with a means of collecting ransoms, while also making it difficult to get the ransom-collectors' identities, thanks to the level of anonymity it offers. WannaCry, the biggest ransomware event of the year, for example, hit hundreds of thousands of PCs around the globe, encrypting files and demanding a payment of $300 in bitcoin for the safe return of what was stored on the machine. In this instance, the ransomware code itself was poorly written and the vast majority of victims were able to restore their systems without giving into the demands of the cyber-attackers. However, by the time those behind WannaCry had withdrawn funds from the associated Bitcoin wallets -- a full three months after the attack -- it meant the 338 payments victims had made were worth around $140,000, which was an increase in value of just under $50,000 compared to when the majority of payments were made. If those behind WannaCry have held onto their illicit investment, they could now be sitting on over $1m of bitcoin. But the sudden spike in bitcoin could actually be problematic for some cybercriminals. Before the surge in value, 1 or 0.5 bitcoin was a common ransom demand, with the idea that if the fee was low enough -- back then the ransom value worked out at a few hundred dollars -- this would encourage the victim to pay up. Even as the value of bitcoin steadily rose during the summer, some attackers were still using the standard amounts of cryptocurrency as their ransom demand.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: collecting ransoms, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: WannaCry, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding a payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: WannaCry, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payments were made, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: WannaCry, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay up, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Two months later, 0.2 bitcoin is currently worth $3,312 while 0.4 bitcoin is up to $6,625. Many forms of ransomware already ask for the payment of a specified amount of dollars to be made in bitcoin. While it pins hopes on victims being able to buy a specific amount of bitcoin and successfully transfer the payment -- which some criminal gangs get around by manning help desks providing advice on buying cryptocurrency -- it's more likely to result in the victim paying up, especially if the figure is just a few hundred dollars. \"I imagine the volatility of bitcoin pricing has been an unexpected problem for cybercriminals. The average ransom demand has remained somewhere between $300 to $1000, and normally the ransom note will specify a USD amount,\" Andy Norton, director of threat intelligence at Lastline, told ZDNet. It isn't just ransomware distributors who might be faced with the problem of valuing items in pure bitcoin: a Dark Web vendor -- whether they are selling malware, weapons, drugs, or any other illegal item -- might find that setting their price in pure bitcoin will quickly result in them pricing themselves out of the market. With bitcoin prices continuing to rise, sophisticated cybercriminal operators can likely react to it, altering prices on a day-to-day basis to ensure that they're able to sustain their business. Criminals are trying out alternative pricing models for ransomware already. Some criminals already operate around the idea that they charge victims just enough so that they don't see the ransom as too much to pay -- and that often depends on the country the victims are in. The Fatboy ransomware payment scheme charges victims in poorer countries less than those in richer ones.

Hackers appear to have pulled off a $1 million heist with ransomware in South Korea. The ransomware attacked more than 153 Linux servers that South Korean web provider Nayana hosted, locking up more than 3,400 websites on June 10. In Nayana's first announcement a few days later, it said the hackers demanded 550 bitcoins to free up all the servers -- about $1.62 million. Four days later, Nayana said it'd negotiated with the attackers and got the payment reduced to 397 bitcoins, or about $1 million. This is the single largest-known payout for a ransomware attack, and it was an attack on one company. For comparison, the WannaCry ransomware attacked 200,000 computers across 150 countries, and has only pooled $127,142 in bitcoins since it surfaced. Ransomware demands have risen rapidly over the past year, tripling in price from 2015 to 2016. But even then, the highest cost of a single ransomware attack was $28,730.  Nayana agreed to pay the ransomware in three installments, and said Saturday it's already paid two-thirds of the $1 million demand. \"It is very frustrating and difficult, but I am really doing my best and I will do my best to make sure all servers are normalized,\" a Nayana administrator said, according to a Google translation of the blog post. The company is expected to make the final payment once all the servers from the first and second payouts have been restored. Trend Micro, a cybersecurity research firm, identified the ransomware as Erebus, which targets Linux servers for attacks. It first surfaced in September through web ads, and popped up again in February. \"It's worth noting that this ransomware is limited in terms of coverage, and is, in fact, heavily concentrated in South Korea,\" Trend Micro researchers said Monday in a blog post.

Affected were a Russian oil giant, a Danish shipping and energy conglomerate, and Ukrainian government ministries, which were brought to a standstill in a wave of ransom demands. The virus even downed systems at the site of the former Chernobyl nuclear power plant, forcing scientists to monitor radiation levels manually. Cyberattacks also spread as far as India and the United States, where the pharmaceutical giant Merck reported on Twitter that \u201cour company\u2019s computer network was compromised today as part of global hack.\u201d The New Jersey-based company said it was investigating the attack. Cyber researchers say that the virus, which was linked to malware called Petrwrap or Petya, used an \u201cexploit\u201d developed by the National Security Agency that was later leaked onto the Internet by hackers. It is the second massive attack in the past two months to turn powerful U.S. exploits against the IT infrastructure that supports national governments and corporations. The onslaught of ransomware attacks may be the \u201cnew normal,\u201d said Mark Graff, the chief executive of Tellagraff, a cybersecurity company. \u201cThe emergence of Petya and WannaCry really points out the need for a response plan and a policy on what companies are going to do about ransomware,\u201d he said. The attack mainly targeted Eastern Europe but also hit companies in Spain, Denmark, Norway and Britain. Victims included the British advertising and marketing multinational WPP and a shipping company, APM Terminals, based at the port of Rotterdam. But the damage was worst in Ukraine. Researchers at Kaspersky Lab\u2019s Global Research and Analysis Team, in Russia, estimated that 60 percent of infected computers were in Ukraine and 30 percent in Russia.  The hacks targeted government ministries, banks, utilities and other important infrastructure and companies nationwide, demanding ransoms from government employees in the cryptocurrency bitcoin.  The hacks\u2019 scale and the use of ransomware recalled the massive cyberattack in May in which hackers possibly linked to North Korea disabled computers in more than 150 nations using a flaw that was once incorporated into the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance tool kit.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransom demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding ransoms, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The full damage of the attack and its economic cost was still unclear, but Europol\u2019s director, Rob Wainwright, said its global reach was precedented, and more victims were likely to become known in the coming days. The extent of the WannaCry attack prompted questions about what to do in the event of a ransomware infection, with many experts advising against paying the ransom, saying not only could it fail to release the data, it could expose victims to further risk. Peter Coroneos, the former chief executive of the Internet Industry Association and an expert on cyber policy, said whether or not to agree to ransomware demands presented practical and ethical dilemmas. \u201cThese people are criminals, and paying money to a criminal is never a good idea. However, if it\u2019s a trade-off between losing your lifetime\u2019s family photos and making a payment to a criminal, then it\u2019s up to the individual to make that judgment call. \u201cIt would be very hard to walk away.\u201d But Gregory said it would be \u201cself-defeating\u201d for hackers not to release data upon receipt of a ransom, \u201cbecause that would immediately hit the media, and no one would pay\u201d. But not all ransomware attacks were motivated by financial gains, he added. \u201cIf they\u2019re a professional criminal organisation, their business model will be to release people\u2019s computers once they\u2019ve paid the money, but you don\u2019t know. It could be someone having a laugh, or someone who\u2019s trying to learn, or someone who\u2019s released it accidentally.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demands for money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the \u201cunprecedented\u201d attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demands money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransoms, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the WannaCry attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: making a payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: receipt of a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid the money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The follow-up attempts to hold the county hostage over illegally encrypted data came just hours after County Manager Dena Diorio announced she\u2019d decided against paying a hacker ransom. Instead of agreeing to pay criminals, she said Wednesday, the county will rebuild its system applications and restore files and data from backups. But by Thursday afternoon, hackers tried to strike again. Diorio sent staff members an email saying, \u201cI have a new warning for employees.\u201d As the county\u2019s IT staff worked to recover from the first cyberattack, Diorio said, they discovered more attempts to compromise computers and data on Thursday. \u201cTo limit the possibility of a new infection, ITS is disabling employees\u2019 ability to open attachments generated by DropBox and Google Documents,\u201d she wrote in an email. \u201cThe best advice for now is to limit your use of emails containing attachments, and try to conduct as much business as possible by phone or in person.\u201d She described the aftermath of the ransomware attack as a \u201ccrisis\u201d and reassured employees they should not feel personally responsible for the incident. The county first learned of the problem earlier this week after an employee opened a malicious \u201cphishing\u201d email and accessed an attached file that unleashed a widespread problem inside the county\u2019s network of computers and information technology. The intent of that ransomware attack was to essentially access as many county government files and data servers as possible. Then, the information was encrypted or locked, keeping employees at the county from accessing operating systems and files. The person or people responsible for the infiltration then demanded the county pay two bitcoins, or about $23,000, in exchange for a release of the locked data. The county refused to pay. County officials say they anticipate the recovery time for Mecklenburg County government operations will take days. \u201cWe are open for business, and we are slow, but there\u2019s no indication of any data loss or that personal information was compromised,\u201d Diorio said. Diorio said third-party security experts believe the attack earlier this week by a new strain of ransomware called LockCrypt originated from Iran or Ukraine.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: rejected a demand for money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: compromise, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: opened, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: data loss, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The situation is the latest example of cyber criminals deploying a form of software known as ransomware, which freezes up files on a computer network until someone enters a decryption code to unlock them. Typically, the code can only be obtained by paying the hackers. An official for the county, which encompasses the city of Charlotte, said the ransomware was triggered when an employee clicked on an email attachment, and that it is wrecking havoc with daily operations: \u201cShe said an example of the problem is the county\u2019s code enforcement office, where much of the work is done electronically. Employees no longer have access to their records. But she said they are switching to paper records for work on Wednesday,\u201d according to the Charlotte Observer. The official also explained that the county faces a dilemma in deciding whether to pay. While paying the ransom may be the only way to obtain the decryption key, there is no guarantee the hackers will honor their commitment and provide the key. The anonymous hackers do not appear to have targeted Mecklenburg county in particular, but rather the official thinks the attack was launched as part of a broader money-making scheme involving ransomware. Similar attacks, which typically exploit old Microsoft software, struck millions of computers in two separate waves earlier this year, affecting everything from businesses to governments to hospitals.

He called the WannaCry attack a reckless attack that caused \"havoc and destruction\" by locking vital information away from users, including hospital networks. \"We believe now we have the evidence to support this assertion,\" Bossert said. \"It's very difficult to do when you're looking for individual hackers. In this case, we found a concerted effort.\" In an opinion piece published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday, Bossert wrote that after careful investigation, Washington can say that Pyongyang is \"directly responsible\" for the WannaCry virus. Bossert called the attack in which victims received ransom demands to unlock their computers \"cowardly, costly and careless.\" \"The consequences and repercussions of WannaCry were beyond economic,\" he wrote. \"The malicious software hit computers in the U.K.'s health-care sector particularly hard, compromising systems that perform critical work. These disruptions put lives at risk.\" Bossert is expected to brief reporters on Tuesday about the hacking. NPR's Elise Hu tells Morning Edition that \"cyberattacks are a way for North Korea to punch above its weight\" and that Pyongyang's hackers \"have access to global networks and the Internet, and they have some real successes to count.\" Within days of the attack in May, North Korea fell under suspicion. As NPR's Bill Chappell reported at the time, WannaCry was found to have \"lines of code that are identical to work by hackers known as the Lazarus Group, [which has] ... been linked to North Korea, raising suspicions that the nation could be responsible.\" And in October, Britain's Minister of State for Security Ben Wallace said his government was \"as sure as possible\" that Pyongyang launched the attack.

A new form of ransomware is indiscriminately targeting millions of PCs, spread by the prolific botnet behind one of the most successful forms of ransomware in the world. The new ransomware is called Jaff and given that it appears to be heavily mimicking tactics of the infamous Locky - the most successful ransomware family of 2016 - it has the potential to become a major nuisance. It's also brazen in its ransom demands, demanding victims pay 1.79 Bitcoins - currently $3,300 - in order to regain access to the infected network and encrypted files. It's an ambitious ransom - most forms of ransomware want a payment of between $500 and $1000 - but the authors are likely to be aware that many organisations are willing to give in and pay to avoid losing business-critical files. As noted by cybersecurity researchers at Forcepoint, the Jaff campaign sprung to life on May 11, using the Necurs botnet to send millions of spam emails emails to targets across the globe in the space of just a few hours. The malicious email itself is sent with a subject line referring to a receipt or to a fake document, with the pattern involving the words PDF, Scan, File, Copy or Document followed by an underscore and a string of at least four numbers - four example, one subject line seen by researchers was 'Copy _293636' Attached to this email is a PDF document containing an embedded DOCM file and a malicious Macro script. If this is run, the ransomware payload is executed and Jaff targets and encrypts a wide variety of file extensions, renaming them all to end in .jaff. While the attack might seem basic - especially compared with targeted spear-phising attacks - the sheer number of messages sent out means that even just a tiny percentage of targets open the email, download the attachment and enable the macros, this new ransomware could have a sizeable impact. As with other ransomware attacks, the infected victim sees their desktop changed to a ransom note and they're directed to instructions, telling them their files are encrypted and that they must visit a dark web address in order to pay to get their files back.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: its ransom demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: an ambitious ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: want a payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the Jaff campaign, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: send, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: emails, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: is sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: spear-phising attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sent out, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The ransom demands from Bad Rabbit\u2019s hackers are similar to those of WannaCry at around $300 per machine.

Ransomware, a kind of malware which locks infected systems, encrypts files and demands a payment in return for decryption, can be debilitating for businesses. Without access to core networks and systems, many firms and organizations will pay up rather than suffer through disruption which can be far more costly in the long run. Consumers also face the same issue, albeit on a personal scale, and while security experts caution that paying up only funds this kind of cybercrime, losing access to your files, photos, and media can be devastating. \tWhen payment demands are a few hundred dollars or so, victims may be more inclined to pay the fee. However, the SamSam ransomware is now demanding far more than the average person would be able to raise. Written in C#, SamSam is usually installed after an unpatched, known server vulnerability is exploited. It is believed the threat actors behind the ransomware are relatively new to extortion, having spent the last few years gradually scaling up their demands. \tThe ransomware caught the attention of the FBI last year, resulting in two alerts being issued. \"MSIL or Samas (SAMSAM) was used to compromise the networks of multiple US victims, including 2016 attacks on healthcare facilities that were running outdated versions of the JBoss content management application,\" the FBI says. \"SAMSAM exploits vulnerable Java-based Web servers. SAMSAM uses open-source tools to identify and compile a list of hosts reporting to the victim's active directory.\"  \"The actors then use psexec.exe to distribute the malware to each host on the network and encrypt most of the files on the system,\" the FBI added. \"The actors charge varying amounts in Bitcoin to provide the decryption keys to the victim.\" According to AlientVault researchers, the ransomware is more akin to a targeted attack than opportunistic ransomware. After being installed on one machine, the ransomware propagates and spreads to any others in the network. SamSam attacks can result in web shell deployment, batch script usage for running the malware over multiple machines, remote access, and tunneling. The ransomware has recently been updated, and will now demand different payments depending on the scope of infection.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: SamSam ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: are demanding, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demands a payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: will pay up, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payment demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the fee, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: is now demanding, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: is exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: extortion, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: their demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: charge, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

In fact, more than 40 per cent of mid-large UK business suffered on average five ransomware attacks during the last year, according to research by Vanson Bourne. However, 92 per cent of security professionals feel confident in their ability to combat ransomware in the future. And there was more good news for British. The survey found the UK to be the most resolute, both in refusing to pay ransom demands, as well as the most effective in combatting them. They experience the fewest number of attacks: 40 per cent, versus 70 per cent in Germany, 59 per cent in France and 55 per cent in the USA and enjoy a 43 per cent success rate in successfully defending against attacks.  The research, commissioned by SentinelOne, reveals that ransomware is costing individual businesses around the globe an average of \u00a3591,238 per annum. The research all concluded that the number of companies ravaged by ransomware is on the rise. Results show that the overall percentage of companies experiencing ransomware has increased from 48 per cent in 2016 to 56 per cent in 2018, however the average number per year has fallen from six to five attacks. The amount of time spent decrypting ransomware attacks has also increased from 33 to 40 man-hours. The study also reveals that employees are considered the major culprits responsible for introducing the malware into the business. This was further supported by the fact that phishing, which seeks to socially engineer employees, was the top attack vector by which ransomware infiltrated the business in 69 per cent of instances.  Migo Kedem, director of Product Management at SentinelOne said: \u201cIt\u2019s staggering to see the cost to British businesses of \u00a3346 million. This figure shows that businesses are becoming increasingly aware that it\u2019s not just the ransom demand, but rather the ancillary costs of downtime, staff time, lost business, as well as the data recovery costs and reputational damage that are the biggest concern to British businesses.\u201d He added: \u201cOn a more positive note, it\u2019s good to see CISOs feeling more bullish about their ability to tackle ransomware using the latest behavioural AI-based end-point technology.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: is costing, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the cyber attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: five ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay ransom demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: is costing, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

First seen on January 26, GandCrab has been spotted being distributed by two exploit kits, RIG EK and GrandSoft EK. According to researchers at security company Malwarebytes, it's unusual in itself for ransomware to be pushed using an exploit kit, with such tactics usually reserved for trojans and coin-miners.  An exploit kit is used by cybercriminals to take advantage of vulnerabilities in systems in order to distribute malware and perform other malicious activities. In contrast, ransomware is usually delivered by spam email. The only other form of ransomware known to be consistently distributed with an exploit kit is Magniber. GandCrab is distributed via the RIG exploit kit, which uses vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash Player to launch JavaScript, Flash, and VBscript-based attacks to distribute malware to users. It's possible that RIG spreads GandCrab to victims using malvertising on compromised websites, in an attack method similar to that used by Princess ransomware. GandCrab is also distributed using GrandSoft, an exploit kit which first appeared in 2012, but was thought to have disappeared. The GrandSoft EK takes advantage of a vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment which allows attackers to remotely execute code, and in this case is used to distribute GandCrab.  Once the payload has been dropped and run on a compromised system, GandCrab, for the most part, acts like any other form of ransomware, encrypting Windows files using an RSA algorithm and demanding payment for the 'GandCrab Decryptor' required to unlock the files. The encrypted files gain a .GDCB extension, with the encryption loop designed in such a way it will eventually affect every file on the drive. However, unlike many forms of ransomware, GandCrab doesn't demand payment in bitcoin, but rather in a form of cryptocurrency called Dash. Those behind the ransomware demand 1.5 Dash (listed on the note as $1,200, although the fluctuating prices mean it's ever changing) as a ransom, a price which doubles to three Dash ($2,400) if the price isn't paid within a few days.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: demands payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

After the infection, the robot is shown insulting its audience and demanding to be 'fed' bitcoin cryptocurrency in order to restore systems back to normal. While a tiny robot making threats might initially seem amusing -- if a little creepy -- the proof-of-concept attack demonstrates the risks associated with a lack of security in robots and how organisations that employ robots could suddenly see parts of their business grind to a halt should they become a victim of ransomware. \"In order to get a business owner to pay a ransom to a hacker, you could make robots stop working. And, because the robots are directly tied to production and services, when they stop working they'll cause a financial problem for the owner, losing money every second they're not working,\" Cesar Cerrudo, CTO at IOActive Labs, told ZDNet. Taking what was learned in previous studies into the security vulnerabilities of robots, researchers were able to inject and run code in Pepper and NAO robots and take complete control of the systems, giving them the option to shut the robot down or modify its actions. The researchers said it was possible for an attacker with access to the Wi-Fi network the robot is running on to inject malicious code into the machine. \"The attack can come from a computer or other device that is connected to internet, so a computer gets hacked, and from there, the robot can be hacked since it's in the same network as the hacked computer,\" said Cerrudo, who conducted the research alongside Lucas Apa, Senior Security Consultant at IOActive. Unlike computers, robots don't yet store vast amounts of valuable information that the user might be willing to pay a ransom to retrieve.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a ransom is paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

If the alternative for a victim of robot ransomware is waiting for a technician to come to fix the robot -- or even losing access it to weeks if it needs to be returned to the manufacturer -- a business owner might view giving into the ransom demand as a lesser evil. \"If it's one robot then it could take less time, but if there are dozens or more, every second they aren't working, the business is losing money. Keeping this in mind, shipping lots of robots takes a lot of time, so the financial impact is bigger when you have a computer compromised with ransomware,\" said Cerrudo. While the robot ransomware infections have been done for the purposes of research -- and presented at the 2018 Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit in Cancun, Mexico -- IOActive warn that if security in robotics isn't properly addressed now, there could be big risks in the near future. \"While we don't see robots every day, they're going mainstream soon, businesses worldwide are deploying robots for different services. If we don't start making robots secure now, if more get out there which are easily hacked, there are very serious consequences,\" said Cerrudo. As with security vulnerabilities the Internet of Things and other products, the solution to this issue is for robotics manufacturers to think about cybersecurity at every step of the manufacturing process from day one. IOActive informed Softbank about the research in January but Cerrudo said: \"We don't know if they [Softbank] are going to fix the issues and when, or even if they can fix the issues with the current design.\" Responding to the IOActive research, a Softbank spokesperson told ZDNet: \"We will continue to improve our security measures on Pepper, so we can counter any risks we may face.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: can fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Ransomware distributors expecting an easy payday are having their illicit earnings stolen by other cybercriminals, who are hijacking the ransom payments before they're received and redirecting them into their own bitcoin wallets. But not only are the attacks giving criminals a taste of their own medicine in becoming victims of cyber-theft, they are also preventing ransomware victims from unlocking their encrypted files -- because, as far as those distributing the malware are concerned, they never received their ransom payment.  Uncovered by researchers at Proofpoint, it's believed to be the first scheme of its kind, with cybercriminals using a Tor proxy browser to carry out man-in-the-middle attacks to steal the cryptocurrency payments, which victims of ransomware are attempting to send to their attackers. The attacks take advantage of the way ransomware distributors request victims to use Tor to buy the cryptocurrency they need to make the ransom payment. While many ransomware notes provide instructions on how to download and run the Tor browser, others provide links to a Tor proxy -- regular websites that translate Tor traffic into normal web traffic -- so the process of paying is as simple as possible for the victim. However, one of the Tor gateways being used is altering bitcoin wallet addresses in the proxy, and redirecting the payment into other accounts, rather than those of the ransomware attacker.  Meanwhile, those behind Magniber ransomware appear to have moved to combat bitcoin address replacement by splitting the HTML source code of wallets into four parts, thus making it harder for proxies to find the address to change. While the sums of bitcoin stolen don't represent a spectacular haul, the interception attacks do create problems for ransomware distributors -- and their victims. The victims are the ultimate losers in this scenario. Not only are they paying hundreds or even thousands of dollars to in ransom demands, they're not even getting their files back in return because the man-in-the-middle attacks mean the ransomware distributors don't think they've been paid.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransom payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: send, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: request, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: been paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Colorado Department of Transportation employees spent a second day offline Thursday as security officials investigated the damage done by a ransomware virus that hijacked computer files and demanded payment in bitcoin for their safe return.

Ransomware attacks, which encrypt and hold a computer user's files hostage in exchange for payment, extort millions of dollars from individuals each month, and comprise one of the fastest-growing forms of cyber attack. In a paper slated for presentation at the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy in May, McCoy and a team including researchers from the University of California, San Diego; Princeton University; Google; and the blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis provide the first detailed account of the ransomware payment ecosystem, from initial attack to cash-out. Key findings include the discovery that South Koreans are disproportionately impacted by ransomware campaigns, with analysis revealing that $2.5 million of the $16 million in ransomware payments tracked by the researchers was paid in South Korea. The paper's authors call for additional research to determine the reason that so many South Koreans are victimized and how they can be protected. The team also found that most ransomware operators used a Russian bitcoin exchange, BTC-E, to convert bitcoin to fiat currencies. (BTC-E has since been seized by the FBI.) The researchers estimate that at least 20,000 individuals made ransomware payments over the past two years, at a confirmed cost of $16 million, although the actual payment total is likely far higher. McCoy and his collaborators took advantage of the public nature of the bitcoin blockchain technology to trace ransom payments over a two-year period\u00ac. Bitcoins are the most common currency of ransomware payments, and because most victims do not own them, the initial bitcoin purchase provides a starting point for tracking payments. Each ransomware victim is often given a unique payment address that directs to a bitcoin wallet where the ransom is collected. The research team tapped public reports of ransomware attacks to identify these addresses and correlate them with blockchain transactions. To boost the number of transactions available for analysis, the team also executed real ransomware binaries in a controlled experimental environment, essentially becoming victims themselves and making micropayments to real ransom wallets in order to follow the bitcoin trail.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransomware payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: Ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: extort, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: are disproportionately impacted, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The research team acknowledged that ethical issues prevent exploration of certain aspects of the ransomware ecosystem, including determining the percentage of victims who actually pay to recover their files. McCoy explained that despite having the ability to check for activity connected to a specific payment address, doing so would effectively \"start the clock\" and potentially cause victims to either pay a double ransom or lose the opportunity to recover their files altogether.

Akamai revealed earlier today that it detected DDoS attacks executed via Memcached servers that were different from others. Instead of blasting targets with UDP packets containing random data, one group of attackers is leaving short messages inside these packets. This one group is asking victims to pay 50 Monero \u2014around $17,000\u2014 to a Monero address. The group doesn't say it will stop the attack but only implies it. Such attacks have first appeared in 2015 and were initially referred to as DDoS-for-Bitcoin after the DD4BTC group that pioneered such tactics. The group would send emails to various companies, threatening to launch DDoS attacks unless they paid a ransom fee. Even if the group's members were arrested, other factions appeared in subsequent years, using unique names such as Armada Collective or XMR Squad, but also mimicking hacker groups such as Anonymous or LulzSec. The tactic, now known as ransom DDoS (RDoS), has become quite popular among cybercriminal groups, and there have been too many RDoS campaigns to remember in the past years. In most past cases, attackers didn't have the firepower to launch DDoS attacks if victims ignored the ransom demand. But the Memcached-based DDoS extortions are different. Attackers clearly have the DDoS cannon to take down companies, mainly due to the large number of unsecured Memcached servers they can abuse to launch these attacks. Victims are also more likely to pay, seeing that they're under a heavy attack and this isn't just an empty threat. But according to Daniel Smith, a Radware security researcher who spoke with Bleeping Computer, paying the Monero ransom won't help companies at all.That's because attackers have used the same Monero address for multiple DDoS attacks against different targets. Here's the same Monero address from the Akamai attacks, but spotted by a different security researcher. Attackers wouldn't have the ability to tell which of the multiple targets they attacked paid the ransom. The general consensus is that this group is using a carpet bombing technique, hitting as many targets as possible for short bursts, hoping to scare one into paying.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: is asking, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid a ransom fee, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom DDoS (RDoS), Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: RDoS campaigns, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: extortions, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: these attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a heavy attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying the Monero ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hitting, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Such attacks \u2014 another of which occurred in Atlanta last week \u2014 take over parts of private or municipal computer networks and then demand payment, or ransom, for their release. Frank Johnson, chief information officer in the Mayor\u2019s Office of Information Technology, said he was not aware of any specific ransom request made by the hackers of Baltimore\u2019s network, but federal authorities are investigating. \u201cThe systems and the software and the files are all being investigated by the FBI right now,\u201d Johnson said. No personal data of city residents was compromised, he added. Dave Fitz, an FBI spokesman, could not be reached Wednesday. On Tuesday, Fitz said the agency was aware of the breach and providing assistance to the city, but otherwise declined to comment. The attack infiltrated a server that runs the city\u2019s computer-aided dispatch, or CAD, system for 911 and 311 calls. The system automatically populates 911 callers\u2019 locations on maps and dispatches the closest emergency responders there more seamlessly than is possible with manual dispatching. It also relays information to first responders in some cases and logs information for data retention and records. The breach shut down the CAD system from Sunday morning until Monday morning, forcing the city to revert to manual dispatching during that time. While the city\u2019s 911 calls are normally recorded online on Open Baltimore, the city dispatch logs stopped recording them at 9:54 a.m. Sunday and didn\u2019t resume recording them again until 7:42 a.m. Monday. Johnson said the attack was made possible after a city information technology team troubleshooting a separate communications issue with the server inadvertently changed a firewall and left a port, or a channel to the Internet, open for about 24 hours, and hackers who were likely running automated scans of networks looking for such vulnerabilities found it and gained access. The Baltimore hack comes amid increasing hacking of municipal systems across the country, and follows one in Atlanta last week that paralyzed that city\u2019s online bill-payment system, with hackers demanding a $51,000 payment in bitcoin to unlock it. That attack occurred Thursday, and Atlanta employees only turned their computers back on Tuesday.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom request, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: demanding, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: That attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

He said the city would be obligated to disclose any attacks that compromised residents\u2019 personal information, health information or crime data. Johnson said he feels the city recovered well from the breach once it was identified, but that he did not want to go into detail about what was done lest he expose the city to more attacks.

A GandCrab ransomware decryption tool has been released as part of the No More Ransom initiative, following a combined operation by Bitdefender, the Romanian Police, the Directorate for Investigating Organized Crime and Terrorism (DIICOT) and Europol. GandGrab first appeared in January and has already claimed over 53,000 victims around the world, making it what Europol describe as \"one of the most aggressive forms of ransomware so far this year\" costing each victim anything from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand. This variant of the file-locking malware is unusual in a number of ways: not only is it spread via the use of exploit kits - a tactic usually reserved for the likes of trojans and cryptocurrency miners - it is also the first form of ransomware to ask for payments in Dash. Most other forms of ransomware demand the ransom be paid in bitcoin or Monero. The spread of GandGrab has also been helped along by a cybercrime-as-a-service scheme which offers a toolkit for deploying the ransomware in exchange for wannabee crooks giving the original authors a cut of their profits. It's unknown which specific cybercriminal operation is behind GandGrab. However, the ransomware is advertised on Russian hacking forums, with the authors explicitly instructing those who become a part of the partnership scheme not to target Russia or any other country in the Commonwealth of Independent States of former Soviet republics. But regardless of who might be distributing GandCrab, now victims don't need to pay a ransom to those looking to cash in on it, because the decryption tool is available for free from the No More Ransom portal and from Bitdefender. \"Ransomware has become a billion-dollar cash cow for malware authors, and GandCrab is one of the highest bidders,\" said Catalin Cosoi, senior director of the investigation and forensics unit at Bitdefender.

In fact, so-called ransomware has become one of the most lucrative criminal enterprises in the U.S. and internationally, with the FBI estimating total payments are nearing $1 billion. Hackers use ransomware to encrypt computer files, making them unreadable without a secret key, and then demand digital currency like bitcoin if victims want the files back \u2014 and many victims are falling for that promise. Ransomware infects more than 100,000 computers around the world every day and payments are approaching $1 billion, said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein during the October 2017 Cambridge Cyber Summit, citing FBI statistics. A study by researchers at Google, Chainalysis, University of California San Diego and NYU Tandon School of Engineering estimated that from 2016 to mid 2017, victims paid $25 million in ransom to get files back. And one out of five businesses that do pay the ransom don\u2019t get their data back, according to 2016 report by Kaspersky Labs. Last spring, the Erie County Medical Center in New York was attacked by SamSam due to a misconfigured web server, according to The Buffalo News. Because it had backed up its files, the hospital decided not to pay the estimated $44,000 ransom. It took six weeks to get back to normal at a recovery cost of nearly $10 million. More recently in January, the new SamSam variant sneaked into Indiana hospital Hancock Health, which decided to pay 4 bitcoin, or about $55,000, in ransom.

It\u2019s easy to say not to negotiate with criminals when it\u2019s not your family photos or business data that you\u2019ll never see again. Unfortunately, if you want your data back, paying the ransom is often the only option,\u201d Dufour said. \u201cHowever, it\u2019s important to know that there are some strains of ransomware that have coding and encryption errors. For these cases, even paying the ransom won\u2019t decrypt your data.

That's because as the CEO of cybersecurity firm Herjavec Group, he doesn't want to support the growing trend of hackers using cryptocurrency. \"I can't invest in something that my enemy uses as funds,\" he explained on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley.\" Indeed, \"If there was no cryptocurrency, much of the large hacks that we're seeing today wouldn't exist,\" Herjavec told Money. As one example, Herjavec is concerned with the role cryptocurrency plays in ransomware attacks. \"Cryptocurrency permits anonymity,\" he explains to CNBC Make It. \"It's a very popular form of payment for ransomware in particular.\" Ransomware is a type of software that locks or encrypts a computer user's data and files, in affect holding it hostage. To release the information, a hacker will demand a ransom payment. Ransomware attacks increased 6,000 percent in 2016 from 2015, according to a study from IBM Security. And in 2017, 200,000 computers in 150 countries belonging to businesses, governments and even the U.K. National Health Service were impacted by the ransomware virus known as WannaCry. In that case, victims were told to make a payment in bitcoin to get their computers back. Hackers often demand the ransom be paid in cryptocurrency because it allows them to remain anonymous, Herjavec says. \"I can take over your computer or personal information, hold it for ransom, give you instructions on how to create a virtual wallet, force you to pay me, and you have no way of finding out who I am,\" Herjavec explains. That's because a bitcoin wallet is only identified by a number, and \"payments are direct without a bank or credit card company acting as the middle man,\" Herjavec says. \"There is no money trail, so it's very difficult to track back to an individual.\" With WannaCry, the hackers asked for $300 worth of bitcoin from victims, and if they waited over 72 hours to pay, the fine increased to $600.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand a ransom payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: Ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: were impacted, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: make a payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: force, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: asked for, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The infection took root last week, on Thursday, January 11, when attackers breached the network of Hancock Health, a regional hospital in the city of Greenfield, Indiana. Attackers deployed the SamSam ransomware, which encrypted files and renamed them with the phrase \"I\u2019m sorry\", according to a local newspaper who broke the news last week. Hospital operations were affected right away. IT staff intervened and took down the entire network, asking employees to shut down all computers to avoid the ransomware from spreading to other PCs. By Friday, the next day, the hospital was littered with posters asking employees to shut down any computer until the incident was resolved. While some news sites reported that the hospital shut down operations, medical and management staff continued their work, but with pen and paper instead of computers. Patients continued to receive care at the hospital's premise. Hospital had backups but decides to pay ransom demand. The hospital said that despite having backups it opted to pay the ransom demand of 4 Bitcoin, which was worth around $55,000 at the time the hospital paid the sum, on Saturday morning. Hospital management told local press that restoring from backups was not a solution as it would have taken days and maybe even weeks to have all systems up and running. Hence, they decided paying the ransom was quicker. By Monday, all systems were up and running, and the hospital released a short statement on its site admitting to the incident, but with very few other details. While the hospital has not confirmed the typical SamSam attack scenario, they did say the infection was not the case of an employee opening a malware-infected email. The FBI has long asked companies and individuals affected by ransomware to report any infections via the IC3 portal so the Bureau can get a better grasp of the threat and have the legal reasons to go after such groups.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: paid a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Greenfield, Indiana-based Hancock Health paid hackers 4 bitcoin or about $47,000 to unlock its network on Saturday, after the health system fell victim to a ransomware attack on Thursday night. Hackers compromised a third-party vendor\u2019s administrative account to the hospital\u2019s remote-access portal and launched SamSam ransomware. The virus infected a number of the hospital\u2019s IT system and, according to local reports, the malware targeted over 1,400 files and changed the name of each to \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d  Hancock officials followed its incident response and crisis management plan and contacted legal representation and outside security firm immediately following the discovery of the attack. Hospital leadership also contacted the FBI for advisory assistance. The incident was contained by Friday and officials said the next focus was recovery.  Hancock Health was given just seven days to pay the ransom. While officials said Hancock could have recovered the affected files from backups, it would have taken days or possibly weeks to do so. And it would have been more expensive. \u201cWe were in a very precarious situation at the time of the attack,\u201d Hancock Health CEO Steve Long said in a statement. \u201cWith the ice and snow storm at hand, coupled with one of the worst flu seasons in memory, we wanted to recover our systems in the quickest way possible and avoid extending the burden toward other hospitals of diverting patients. Restoring from backup was considered, though we made the deliberate decision to pay the ransom to expedite our return to full operations.\u201d Hackers released the files early Saturday after they retrieved the bitcoins. The hospital\u2019s critical systems were restored to normal function on Monday. The forensic analysis found patient data was not transferred outside of the hospital\u2019s network, and the FBI confirmed the motivation for SamSam hackers is ransom payment, not to harvest patient data. The virus did not impact any equipment used to treat patients. However, the hospital\u2019s patient portal was down during the security incident. After recovery, officials asked employees to reset passwords and implemented a security feature that could detect similar attacks in the future.

In fact, so-called ransomware has become one of the most lucrative criminal enterprises in the U.S. and internationally, with the FBI estimating total payments are nearing $1 billion. Hackers use ransomware to encrypt computer files, making them unreadable without a secret key, and then demand digital currency like bitcoin if victims want the files back \u2014 and many victims are falling for that promise. To better understand how ransomware works and how it has spread so effectively, The Denver Post talked with Broomfield anti-malware company Webroot, which got its start in the late 1990s cleansing computer viruses from personal computers. \u201cThe end goal is just to put ransomware on the computer because right now the most successful way for cybercriminals to make money is with ransoming your files,\u201d said Tyler Moffitt, a senior threat research analyst at Webroot. Ransomware infects more than 100,000 computers around the world every day and payments are approaching $1 billion, said U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein during the October 2017 Cambridge Cyber Summit, citing FBI statistics. A study by researchers at Google, Chainalysis, University of California San Diego and NYU Tandon School of Engineering estimated that from 2016 to mid 2017, victims paid $25 million in ransom to get files back. And one out of five businesses that do pay the ransom don\u2019t get their data back, according to 2016 report by Kaspersky Labs. It\u2019s a growing business for cybercriminals. And whether to pay or not is something each user or company must decide.

The ransomware attack accessed the computers of Hancock Health in Greenfield through an outside vendor's account Thursday. It quickly infected the system by locking out data and changing the names of more than 1,400 files to \"I'm sorry.\" The virus demanded four bitcoins in exchange for unlocking the data, which included patient medical records and company emails. The hospital paid the amount, about $50,000 at the time, early Saturday morning, said Rob Matt, senior vice president and chief strategy officer. \"It wasn't an easy decision,\" Matt said. \"When you weigh the cost of delivering high-quality care ... versus not paying and bearing the consequences of a new system.\" The data started unlocking soon after the money was transferred, Matt said. \"The amount of the ransom was reasonable in respect to the cost of continuing down time and not being able to care for patients,\" Matt said. Hancock Health includes about two dozen health care facilities, including Hancock Regional Hospital in Greenfield, about 15 miles east of Indianapolis. The health system said in a news release that patient data was not compromised. Life support and other critical hospital services were not affected, and patient safety was never at risk. Ransomware is a growing digital extortion technique that affected tens of thousands of Americans in 2016, USA TODAY reported.  Criminals use various phishing methods through emails or bogus links to infect victims with malicious software. The virus infects the computer network by encrypting files or locking down the entire system. Victims log on and receive a message telling them the files have been hijacked and to get the files back they will have to pay. Hospitals are a frequent target of these attacks. In May, a ransomware virus affected more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries, including more than 20% of hospitals in the United Kingdom. That attack was later traced to North Korea. Hancock Health said it worked with the FBI and hired an Indianapolis cybersecurity expert for advice on how to respond to the attack. The systems were back Monday after paying the ransom. \u201cWe were in a very precarious situation at the time of the attack,\" Hancock Health CEO Steve Long said in a statement.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was not compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing methods, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: have to pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

On Thursday, municipal courts were closed again and residents were unable to pay their traffic tickets or water bills online. In some cases, employees had to fill out urgent forms and reports by hand, CNN reported.  The city allowed its employees to turn on their work computers and printers for the first time on Wednesday, although officials warned that some computers may still be affected.  In a ransomware attack, hackers place malware on a computer \u2014 or system of computers \u2014 that restricts access, and then demand payment to undo it. The culprits have demanded the city of Atlanta pay them $51,000 in bitcoin to unlock the government's encrypted systems. Bottoms would not say whether the city would meet their request. Atlanta officials \u2014 along with local law enforcement, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and Secret Service \u2014 are said to be working round-the-clock on the matter to investigate whether any government data or anybody's personal information was compromised. An information portal has been set up on the city government's website to keep residents and employees updated on the latest developments of the hack. Officials from Atlanta Information Management, the city's technology department, realized the city had been attacked on March 22.   As a result, officials said, \"some city data is encrypted and customers are not able to access city applications.\" This has mostly prevented people from using online applications to pay bills and access court-related information. Although Atlanta officials have not yet identified those behind the attack, an Atlanta-based security firm called Dell SecureWorks, which is helping the city investigate the attack, pointed to a group called SamSam, according to The New York Times. It is not clear who is part of the group or where it is based. On Monday, Mayor Bottoms held a news conference to reassure the public that the city was doing everything in its power to restore its systems, but cautioned people against taking the matter lightly. \"I just want to make the point that this is much bigger than a ransomware attack,\" Bottoms said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: have demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Ransomware is a malicious software that prevents or limits users from accessing their system by locking them out until a ransom is paid. NBC affiliate WXIA reported that the city received a ransom demand in bitcoin for $6,800 per unit or $51,000 to unlock the entire system. CNN has not independently confirmed the report. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms advised city employees to contact credit agencies and monitor their bank accounts in case their personal data was compromised. She urged the public to take the same precautions while investigators work to determine the scope of the attack. \"We don't know the extent so we just ask that you be vigilant,\" Bottoms said in a Thursday news conference. \"All of us are subject to this attack, if you will. Many of us pay our bills online, we have direct deposit, so go online and check your bank statements.\"  Atlanta Chief Operating Officer Richard Cox confirmed that the city received a written demand related to the attack. When asked in the news conference if the city was going to pay a ransom, Bottoms said, \"We can't speak to that right now.\" \"We will be looking for guidance from, specifically, our federal partners on how to best navigate the best course of action,\" she said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Homeland Security are investigating the cyberattack, which Atlanta Information Management officials learned of Thursday at 5:40 a.m., Cox said. DHS spokesman Scott McConnell said the agency offered technical expertise and support and referred questions to the city. The city announced outages earlier Thursday to various customer-facing applications, including those used to pay bills and access court-related information. Thursday afternoon, Cox said several departments were affected, too. Some city data remains encrypted while investigators continue to determine the scope of the attack, he said. The city's payroll has not been affected, he said. Public safety and water services are operating without incident.

Our city website, Atlantaga.gov, remains accessible and we will provide updates as we receive them.\u201d  As of Thursday afternoon, the city said it faced outages on various \u201cinternal and customer facing applications,\u201d such as means for accessing court-related information and paying bills. But the city itself isn\u2019t exactly under siege: Airport, public safety, and water operations remain unaffected by the attack, and the city payroll wasn\u2019t touched. The only bone Atlanta is throwing the public is that the attack affects \u201cvarious city systems.\u201d  According to Atlanta\u2019s newly appointed chief operating officer, Richard Cox, Atlanta Information Management officials were made aware of problems with internal and customer-facing applications at 5:40 a.m. Thursday. At the time, he acknowledged that the city fell prey to ransomware, but given the investigation is still ongoing, he couldn\u2019t provide the extent of the damage.   \u201cThe ongoing investigation will determine whether personal information, financial, or employee data has been compromised,\u201d he said during a press briefing. \u201cAs a precaution, we are asking that all employees take the appropriate measures to ensure their data is not compromised. The city advises employees to monitor and protect personal information and in the coming days we will offer employees additional resources if needed.\u201d  What the city didn\u2019t officially disclose was the ransomware note discovered in the investigation.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: attacked, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: has been compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: is not compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Instead, hackers find unpatched vulnerabilities in network servers and manually unleash SamSam to seize key data systems and cause maximum damage to the company\u2019s infrastructure.  SamSam is one of many in a family of ransomware targeting government and healthcare organizations. It was first observed in 2015 and encrypts various file types using the Advanced Encryption Standard (aka Rijndael).

Hackers encrypted many of the city government's vital data and computer systems. The ransomware attack, which Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms characterized as \"a hostage situation,\" forced the city to shut down municipal courts and even prevented residents from paying bills online. The city has been unable to issue warrants, and in many cases city employees have had to fill out forms and reports by hand. The hackers demanded that officials pay a ransom of US$51,000 to be sent to a bitcoin wallet. Threat researchers from Dell-owned Secureworks, which is based in Atlanta, have been working to help the city recover from the attack. The security firm identified the assailants as the SamSam hacking group, The New York Times reported on Thursday. That organization has been known for similar ransomware attacks; it typically makes ransom demands of $50,000 or more, usually payable only with bitcoin. Secureworks has been working with the city's incident response team as well as the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service. In addition, a number of independent experts, including researchers from Georgia Tech, have been called in to determine how the attack occurred and help strategize to prevent another such attack. As of Thursday, the city's Department of Information Management, which first discovered the attack on March 21, said that it had found no evidence that customer or employee data was compromised. It nevertheless encouraged everyone to take precautionary measures, including the monitoring of personal accounts and protecting personal information.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Efforts by lenders to bolster their IT defences against hackers have simply encouraged fraudsters to bombard individual customers with scams, according to Financial Fraud Action UK. Despite investing millions in tackling fraud, losses from fraud rose last year as banks became less effective at preventing scams. Financial Fraud Action UK said this was \u2018largely due to criminals shifting their methods away from using malware attacks on online banking systems, which bank security processes identified\u2019. Increasingly, it said, fraudsters are focussing on targeting individuals directly, which is harder for banks to stop. The report said the main ploy used by criminals is the \u2018impersonation and deception scam\u2019 whereby they pretend to be from a \u2018legitimate and trusted organisation\u2019 such as a bank, the police, a utility company or a government department. These scams typically involve the fraudster contacting the customer through a phone call, text message or email. Often the fraudster will claim there has been suspicious activity on an account, ask the individual to verify or update their account details, or claim they are due a refund. The criminal then attempts to trick the target into giving away their personal or financial information, such as passwords, payment card details or bank account information. Financial Fraud Action UK \u2013 which represents banks - said its intelligence suggests criminals have also recently increased their focus on \u2018phishing\u2019 emails claiming to be from major online retailers and internet companies. It warned these emails are an \u2018increasingly sophisticated\u2019 attempt to trick recipients into giving away personal and financial details, or into downloading malware software which hacks into their computers. Several banks have been targeted by high profile cyber attacks that have attempted to exploit weaknesses in their IT systems. Last November criminals launched an online attack against Tesco Bank that resulted in the loss of \u00a32.5million from 9,000 accounts. Others to have been targeted include Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest, Lloyds and HSBC. The threat to Britain\u2019s financial infrastructure from persistent cyber-attacks prompted chancellor Philip Hammond to commit an extra \u00a31.9billion in the autumn statement to boost Britain\u2019s defences against the growing online threat.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: pretend to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: contacting, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claim, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claim, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claiming to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Local cybersecurity professionals are creating interactive comic books, testing employees with simulated phishing emails \u2014 tailored messages that seek to obtain key information, such as passwords \u2014 and seeking to convince top executives that the threat of business disruption from hacking requires their attention. \u201cThe biggest problem is not the technology; it\u2019s the people,\u201d said Laurin Buchanan, principal investigator at Secure Decisions, a division of Northport software developer Applied Visions Inc.  Sixty percent of cyber-assaults on businesses can be traced to insiders\u2019 actions, either inadvertent or malicious, according to a 2016 study by IBM Security. The average cost of a data breach for U.S. companies is $7.4 million, or $225 per lost or stolen record, a June 2017 study by IBM and the Ponemon Institute, a Traverse City, Michigan, researcher, found. Costs related to data breaches can include the investigation, legal costs to defend against and settle class-action lawsuits, credit monitoring for affected customers, and coverage of fraud losses. Harder to gauge is the cost to a company\u2019s reputation. One of the largest hacks ever was disclosed this month, when credit reporting company Equifax Inc. revealed that sensitive data from 143 million consumers, including Social Security numbers and birth dates, was exposed. A stock analyst from Stifel Financial Corp. estimated that the attack will cost Equifax about $300 million in direct expenses. Investors seem to think the incident will have a much greater impact on At a seminar in Garden City this month, Henry Prince, chief security officer at Shellproof Security in Greenvale, explained how in a ransomware attack \u2014 one of many types \u2014 cybercriminals can buy specialized tools such as those used to send phishing emails. The easy availability of that software means that hackers require \u201cno programming experience,\u201d Prince said. Phishing emails can be blocked by company email filters, firewalls and anti-virus software. But if one gets through and an employee clicks on the link in the phishing email, the business\u2019 network is compromised. Hackers can then encrypt files, preventing access to them by the company and crippling the business, Prince said at the seminar.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: hacks, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: send, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: gets through, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Training employees is one of the best steps in shoring up your defenses.\u201d In response, many local experts and companies focus on teaching employees how to resist hackers\u2019 tricks. Secure Decisions has developed interactive comics to teach employees ways of detecting \u201cphishing\u201d emails and other hacking attempts. The company has gotten more than $1 million for research related to the interactive comic project, known as Comic-BEE, from the Department of Homeland Security, as well as a grant for $162,262 from the National Science Foundation. The comics, inspired by children\u2019s \u201cChoose Your Own Adventure\u201d books, feature different plots depending on the reader\u2019s choices. \u201cIf you can give people the opportunity to role-play, some of the exhortations by the experts will make more sense,\u201d Buchanan said. The comics are being field-tested at several companies and Stony Brook University. They were featured in July at a DHS cybersecurity workshop in Washington, D.C. Radu Sion, a computer science professor at Stony Brook and director of its National Security Institute, which studies how to secure digital communications, acknowledged that security is far from a priority for most users. \u201cUltimately, the average Joe doesn\u2019t care,\u201d he said. \u201cYou [should] treat the vast majority of your users as easily hackable.\u201d Northwell Health, the New Hyde Park-based health care system that is the largest private employer in New York State, is trying to find and get the attention of those inattentive employees. Kathy Hughes, Northwell vice president and chief information security officer, sends out \u201cphishing simulations\u201d to the workforce.

The group has also set up a news outlet called The British News Agency to lure targets in.  Most of the group's targets are in Iran, the U.S., Israel and the U.K., the report said, but some come from countries including France, Germany, Switzerland, Denmark, India, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.  The report detailed the various methods used to gain access to computers and private social accounts. Those include false identities, the impersonation of real companies, the insertion of malicious code into a breached website, also known as \"watering hole attacks,\" and spear phishing, the process of pretending to be service providers like Gmail or Facebook to trick people into giving out personal information. A significant mainstay of the group's activity was the establishment of a media outlet called The British News Agency. Much effort went into creating a seemingly legitimate website, including details about the agency and a contact list of the management team. The purpose of the site was to attract the targets and infect them with malware. According to the report, multiple Israeli researchers of Iran and the Middle East were sent emails and Twitter direct messages from accounts registered with seemingly Jewish Israeli names. Messages coming from one such account were presented as if coming from a journalist and political researcher at KNBC News. Other messages were presented as if coming from an Israeli political researcher raised in California who needed help with an article and also wanted to apply for a position at an Israeli university. Another message was described as coming from a Jewish girl living in Iran. These messages often linked to phishing pages. ClearSky cannot estimate how many accounts were successfully infiltrated, but the success rate for such attacks is usually around 10%, said Mr. Dolev.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: set up, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: gain access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the impersonation, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: spear phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: pretending to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: creating, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: attract, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: coming from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were presented as if coming from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were presented as if coming from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: coming from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

WhatsApp did once charge a subscription fee of $0.99/\u00a30.99, but stopped the practice in January 2016. However, the fraudsters behind this latest scam are looking to take advantage of the fact WhatsApp -- which has over a billion users -- did once rely on a subscription service to dupe victims into handing over their banking information. The UK's fraud and cybercrime centre Action Fraud and the City of London police have issued a warning about the campaign. Emails purporting to be from 'The WhatsApp Team' claim that \"your subscription will be ending soon\" and that in order to continue to use the service, you need to update your payment information. Victims are encouraged to sign into a 'customer portal' with their number and to enter payment information.  Naturally, this is a scam -- with spelling errors in the text a huge giveaway -- and all the victims are doing is providing criminals with their financial details. Criminals could use these to simply make purchases or as a basis for further fraud. Scammers have also been known to use text messages in an effort to dupe victims into paying for a fake subscription. Those who receive the email are urged not to click on any of the links, but to instead report it to the police. Action Fraud also offers advice to those who have already fallen for the scam, telling victims to \"run antivirus software to ensure your device has not been infected with malware\". Scammers often attempt to lure victims into handing over their credit card information -- or installing malware onto their machines -- often with authentic-looking phishing emails claiming to be from real companies. Previously, Action Fraud has warned about scammers attempting to steal credentials from university staff with fake emails about a pay rise, while police have also issued a warning about cybercriminals attempting to infect people with banking malware using emails that pretend to be from a charity.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: dupe, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: purporting to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: dupe, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: receive, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claiming to be from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: pretend to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Casundra Venable told FOX59 she has sold on eBay for five years with no problems, but recently she fell victim to a scam. Venable was selling a Samsung phone with accessories on the website. Her sale closed, she received a $227 payment, and then a message that she thought was from the buyer. \"Thanks so much for (an) interesting auction. It was hard to choose the present for my friend. I think my friend will love this,\" Venable said, reading the message. The writer sent her supposed friend's address, and Venable sent the package to that address. A few days later, she received a message from eBay saying the buyer had not received the package. It was then that she realized the message had been a fake. \"I thought, you know, 'How stupid (was I) for doing it?\" Venable said. Venable said she was on the lookout for scams, but only those that come from people outside the eBay website. She assumed that because the message came through a real account, it was legitimate. It turns out, the scammer hacked into a real user's account and used it to find a closing sale, then pretended to be the buyer. \"If they ask you to send it somewhere besides their registered address, say no,\" Venable said. FOX59 spoke with the Better Business Bureau's Tim Maniscalo, who said that while he had not heard of this specific type of eBay scam, it didn't surprise him. \"Well over 50 percent of the scams (we see) now are perpetrated in some way, shape, or form through the internet,\" Maniscalo said. Venable tried to get her package back, but she could not get it from the warehouse in Brooklyn, New York where it ended up. \"(A man on the phone) said it\u2019s off to the country of Georgia,\" Venable said.

On Feb 3, district administrators learned that two payroll employees had fallen for an email phishing scam. A hacker posing as Superintendent Diana Greene sent an email to one of the employees, requesting all W-2 forms for district employees. The Manatee payroll employee complied, and with the help of another employee, sent the hacker a PDF file containing all 7,700 W-2s for any employee who worked in the district in 2016. Because of the freshness of the attack, Fletcher wasn\u2019t taking any chances. Rather than hand over the sensitive information to the man claiming to be from the government, Fletcher drove the file down to the IRS office himself. \u201cNow we are going to be like Fort Knox,\u201d said Deputy Superintendent Ron Ciranna.

That is, until 2016, when the John Podesta email hack made big enough news that hackers\u2019 dirty secret got out: many breaches have less to do with coding skills and much more to do with classic trickery, albeit in digital form. Web users simply get duped into entering their username and passwords onto fake websites. With that information, it doesn\u2019t take any special cleverness to hack a system. The attacker has the keys. The chief tool hackers use to lure unsuspecting people to these phony websites is email. When the victim works at a company of some kind, those credentials might provide cyber-criminals with access to more than just email. The same credentials might also provide access to intranets, servers and sensitive data. Executives are looking hard for ways to protect their operations today without cramping employee productivity. One method many might be looking at is virtual machines, workspaces that run software on the cloud but looks to the user just like a normal desktop. As counter-measures go, muckraking news outlet The Intercept has sung its praises. As it happens, Amazon Web Services announced a new offer on its blog Thursday\u201440 hours of virtual machinery free to users and companies that might want to try it out. Windows 7 and Windows 10 experiences are available. Working inside a window into the cloud protects physical devices from evil code a user might get tricked into initializing. Called WorkSpaces, it can give staff access to all of a company\u2019s data and tools from anywhere. If an employee is working from home and gets hit by ransomware, it encrypts everything on the hard drive and demands payment in bitcoin to set data free.

Both organizations targeted in the attacks are currently fighting against for Net Neutrality in the US. Based on currently available evidence, the attacks appear to have been orchestrated by the same attacker, located in a UTC+3-5:30 timezone, said EFF Director of Cybersecurity Eva Galperin and EFF security researcher Cooper Quintin. At least one victim fell for the attacks \"Although this phishing campaign does not appear to have been carried out by a nation-state actor and does not involve malware, it serves as an important reminder that civil society is under attack,\" said the two today. \"It is important for all activists, including those working on digital civil liberties issues in the United States, to be aware that they may be targeted by persistent actors who are well-informed about their targets\u2019 personal and professional connections.\" At least one victim fell for the 70 fake emails sent during the phishing attempts. Attackers didn't deliver malware but lured victims away on a remote site designed to phish Google, Dropbox, and LinkedIn credentials. \"The attackers were remarkably persistent, switching up their attacks after each failed attempt and becoming increasingly creative with their targeting over time,\" EFF said. The most creative of the spear-phishing emails was when victims received emails with the subject line \"You have been successfully subscribed to Pornhub.com,\" or \"You have been successfully subscribed to Redtube.com,\" two very popular adult video portals. Minutes later, victims received another email made to look like it was coming from the same two services. These second emails contained explicit subject lines. Because spear-phishing emails were aimed at work emails, most victims would have been inclined to unsubscribe from the incoming emails. This was the catch, as attackers doctored the unsubscribe link, leading victims to a fake Google login screen.  Attackers used different tactics as the campaign progressed The PornHub and RedTube phishes were not the only ones.

The attack campaign involves crypto-locking Locky ransomware. \"Beware. Don't fall for this. Locky is horrid,\" says Alan Woodward, a computer science professor at the University of Surrey. The campaign began Monday, according to cloud-based cybersecurity provider AppRiver, which counted more than 23 million related spam emails having been sent in less than 24 hours. That makes it \"one of the largest malware campaigns that we have seen in the latter half of 2017,\" says Troy Gill, manager of security research for AppRiver, in a blog post. Finnish security firm F-Secure says that the majority of the spam messages that its systems are currently blocking relate to Locky. It notes that some spam contains links to infected sites, while other messages carry malicious attachments. If a system becomes infected with this strain of Locky, crypto-locked files will have the extension \".lukitus\" added, which is a Finnish word variously translated by native speakers as \"locking\" or \"locked,\" according to F-Secure. The Lukitus variant of Locky was first spotted last month. Rommel Joven, a malware researcher with security firm Fortinet, warned that it was being distributed via email attachments as part of a massive spam campaign being run by the one of the world's biggest botnets, Necurs, which has historically been the principle outlet for Locky attacks.  Spam Can Carry Locky Attachments AppRiver says emails related to the new Locky campaign have featured a variety of subject lines, including these words: documents, images, photo, pictures, please print, scans. \"Each message comes with a zip attachment that contains a Visual Basic Script (VBS) file that is nested inside a secondary zip file,\" Gill says. \"Once clicked, [the] VBS file initiates a downloader that reaches out to greatesthits[dot]mygoldmusic[dotcom] to pull down the latest Locky ransomware. Locky goes to work encrypting all the files on the target system and appending [.]lukitus to the users now-encrypted files.\" The ransomware then drops a ransom note on the victim's desktop.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: A new attack campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: has been flinging, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: having been sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: drops, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Internet Storm Center reports that some malicious messages tied to Locky are showing fake alerts stating that the HoeflerText font needs to be installed. Not all of the Locky spam emails arrive with malicious attachments; some are designed as phishing attacks that redirect users to real-looking but malicious sites. Peter Kruse, an e-crime specialist at CSIS Security Group in Denmark, says some emails related to this ransomware campaign are skinned to look like they've come from Dropbox. Some will attempt to trick recipients into clicking on a \"verify your email\" link. Kruse says the attacks are being launched by the group tied to the Affid=3 [aka affiliate ID=3] version of Locky.  If victims click on the link, they're redirected to one of a number of websites. Clicking on a link can result in a zipped attack file being downloaded, per the VBS attack detailed above, according to security researcher JamesWT, a former member of the anti-malware research group called Malware Hunter Team. Alternately, clicking on the link may result in the site attempting to execute a malicious JavaScript file that functions as a dropper, meaning it then attempts to download a payload file. In some attacks, this payload file is Locky. But JamesWT tells ISMG that malware from the campaign that he uploaded to malware-checking service VirusTotal was identified as being Shade ransomware.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: process payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: showing fake alerts, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: skinned to look like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: come from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Researchers have found that a popular Internet of Things real-time operating system \u2013 FreeRTOS \u2013 is riddled with serious vulnerabilities. The bugs could allow hackers to crash connected devices in smart homes or critical infrastructure systems, leak information from the devices\u2019 memory, and take them over. And while patches have been issued, researchers warn that it still may take time for smaller vendors to update. Researcher Ori Karliner, with Zimperium\u2019s zLabs team, recently analyzed some of the leading operating systems in the IoT market \u2013 including FreeRTOS, an open-source OS specifically designed for the microcontrollers that are within IoT devices. Within several versions of FreeRTOS, Karliner found 13 vulnerabilities enabling an array of attacks, including remote code execution, information leak and denial-of-service bugs. \u201cDuring our research, we discovered multiple vulnerabilities within FreeRTOS\u2019s TCP/IP stack and in the AWS secure connectivity modules. The same vulnerabilities are present in WHIS Connect TCP/IP component for OpenRTOS\\SafeRTOS,\u201d according to a Thursday post by zLabs. The vulnerabilities specifically exist in FreeRTOS\u2019s TCP/IP stack and in the AWS secure connectivity modules (in as well as in the WHIS Connect TCP/IP component for OpenRTOS\\SafeRTOS). These vulnerabilities include four remote code execution bugs (CVE-2018-16522, CVE-2018-16525, CVE-2018-16526, and CVE-2018-16528); seven information leak vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-16524, CVE-2018-16527, CVE-2018-16599, CVE-2018-16600, CVE-2018-16601, CVE-2018-16602, CVE-2018-16603) one denial of service flaw (CVE-2018-16523) and a final (CVE-2018-16598) that was unspecified. zLabs said it has disclosed the security issues to Amazon and collaborated with them to patch the vulnerabilities.

Yeah, the Japanese gaming firm has only gone and fixed it, according to console hacker Michael. Michael, who goes by the Twitter handle @SciresM, tweeted that it's bad news for console hackers and Nintendo is pushing out new console models with a fix that stops tech-savvy folks from messing around with the software that the hybrid games console can boot with. The flaw was thought to be un-patchable as it affected the Nvidia Tegra X1 chip that sits at the heart of the console. But Nintendo hates piracy more than most games firms, and as such, will release new versions of the Switch that don't have the silicon-level flaw in them. The patch involves using a system called  \u2018iPatches' which updates parts of the code applying to the Tegra X1's fuses which plugs the boot hacking exploit.  Current consoles out in the wild will still be vulnerable due to the patch needing to be applied at a hardware level, but new models won't be susceptible to the hack.  But there's a bit of an odd situation here, as the new consoles will come running 4.1.0 versions of the Switch firmware; the latest Switch firmware is 5.1.0. So while the new Switchers will come off the production line immune to the Tegra X1 exploit, they will still be vulnerable to other hacking techniques.  With this in mind, Michael advises that people keen to crack into their Switch consoles should not apply any updates, as the older version of the console's firmware is the easier it's to hack. So while the un-patchable flaw may have been fixed the current iteration of the Switch is still no un-hackable. Not that hacking the Switch is a good idea if you want to run pirated games, as Nintendo takes a very dim view of that and cracks down so hard on pirates that it'll permanently ban any console caught with bootlegged software from its online network. With The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Mario Odyssey alone there are tens of hours of gaming to be had on the Switch. let along all the stuff that's incoming and the suite of indie titles the console supports.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: is pushing out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: updates, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: plugs, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be applied, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: apply, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The new guidance, issued April 2, adds a \u201cstopped\u201d status to Intel\u2019s \u201cproduction status\u201d category in its array of available Meltdown and Spectre security updates. \"Stopped\" indicates there will be no microcode patch to kill off Meltdown and Spectre. The guidance explains that a chipset earns \u201cstopped\u201d status because, \u201cafter a comprehensive investigation of the microarchitectures and microcode capabilities for these products, Intel has determined to not release microcode updates for these products for one or more reasons.\u201d Those reasons are given as:      Micro-architectural characteristics that preclude a practical implementation of features mitigating [Spectre] Variant 2 (CVE-2017-5715)     Limited Commercially Available System Software support     Based on customer inputs, most of these products are implemented as \u201cclosed systems\u201d and therefore are expected to have a lower likelihood of exposure to these vulnerabilities.  Thus, if a chip family falls under one of those categories \u2013 such as Intel can't easily fix Spectre v2 in the design, or customers don't think the hardware will be exploited \u2013 it gets a \"stopped\" sticker. To leverage the vulnerabilities, malware needs to be running on a system, so if the computer is totally closed off from the outside world, administrators may feel it's not worth the hassle applying messy microcode, operating system, or application updates. \"Stopped\" CPUs that won\u2019t therefore get a fix are in the Bloomfield, Bloomfield Xeon, Clarksfield, Gulftown, Harpertown Xeon C0 and E0, Jasper Forest, Penryn/QC, SoFIA 3GR, Wolfdale, Wolfdale Xeon, Yorkfield, and Yorkfield Xeon families.

In January and February, Redmond emitted fixes for Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 machines to counter the Meltdown chip-level vulnerability in modern Intel x64 processors. Unfortunately, those patches blew a gaping hole in the operating systems: normal applications and logged-in users could now access and modify any part of physical RAM, and gain complete control over a box, with the updates installed. Rather than stop programs and non-administrators from exploiting Meltdown to extract passwords and other secrets from protected kernel memory, the fixes on Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 instead granted full read-write privileges to system RAM. Roll on March, and Microsoft pushed out fixes on Patch Tuesday to correct those January and February updates to close the security vulnerability it accidentally opened. Except that March update didn't fully seal the deal: the bug remained in the kernel, and was exploitable by malicious software and users.   Total Meltdown Now, if you're using Windows 7 or Server 2008 R2 and have applied Microsoft's Meltdown patches, you'll want to grab and install today's out-of-band update for CVE-2018-1038. Swedish researcher Ulf Frisk discovered the January and February Meltdown mitigations for Win7 and Server 2008 R2 were broken, and went public with his findings once the March Patch Tuesday had kicked off. As it turns out, this month's updates did not fully fix things, and Microsoft has had to scramble to remedy what was now a zero-day vulnerability in Windows 7 and Server 2008. In other words, Microsoft has just had to put out a patch for a patch for a patch. Hardly inspiring stuff, but we suppose the old Microsoft adage remains true \u2013 never trust a Redmond product until version three at the earliest.

Foscam  is urging customers to update their security cameras after researchers found three vulnerabilities in that could enable a bad actor to gain root access knowing only the camera\u2019s IP address. The vulnerability trifecta includes an arbitrary file-deletion bug, a shell command-injection flaw and a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability according to the researchers at VDOO who found the flaws. The proof-of-concept attack revolved around a process in the cameras called webService, which receives requests from servers and can be used to verify the user\u2019s credentials, if necessary, and run the handler for the desired API command. To launch an attack, an attacker would have to obtain the camera\u2019s IP address or DNS name. Generally if the camera is configured so that it has direct interface to the internet, its address might be exposed to certain internet scanners. The PoC attacker then crashed the webService process by exploiting the stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2018-6832). After it crashes, the webService process automatically restarts via the watchdog daemon (which restarts important processes after they\u2019re terminated), and during the process reload, an attacker could leverage a second flaw, the arbitrary file-deletion vulnerability (CVE-2018-6830), to delete certain critical files. This will result in authentication bypass when the webService process reloads; so that the bad actor is able to gain administrative credentials. From there, an attacker could use the third vuln (CVE-2018-6831) to execute root commands. This bug is a shell command-injection vulnerability that requires administrator credentials. \u201cSince the adversary gained administrator credentials in the previous stage, he can now use this vulnerability to execute commands as the root user for privilege escalation,\u201d researchers said. The Internet of Things continues to post a significant problem as many connected devices lack proper security controls.

Microsoft quietly fixed the issue on Windows 10 Redstone 4 (v1803), also known as the April 2018 Update, released on Monday. \"Welp, it turns out the Meltdown patches for Windows 10 had a fatal flaw: calling NtCallEnclave returned back to user space with the full kernel page table directory, completely undermining the mitigation,\" Ionescu wrote.  Microsoft issued today an security update, but it wasn't to backport the \"fixed\" Meltdown patches for older Windows 10 versions. Instead, the emergency update fixed a vulnerability in the Windows Host Compute Service Shim (hcsshim) library (CVE-2018-8115) that allows an attacker to remotely execute code on vulnerable systems. Microsoft classified CVE-2018-8115 as a \"critical\" issues. A patched hcsshim file is available for download from GitHub.  \"We are aware and are working to provide customers with an update,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told Bleeping Computer today in an email. It may be that if Microsoft doesn't bundle these fixes in an out-of-band update, they will most likely arrive in Microsoft's May 2018 Patch Tuesday, but this is only our speculation. Microsoft released its Meltdown and Spectre patches on January 4, a day after security researchers disclosed the two flaws, vulnerabilities that allow attackers to retrieve data from protected areas of modern CPUs. The Redmond-based OS maker has had a hard time patching the two flaws, and the company recently issued additional security updates to fix the original Spectre mitigations, and also deliver Intel CPU microcode updates, as a favor to Intel.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: were affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: turns out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: classified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: provide, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: arrive, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: deliver, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The critical vulnerability, CVE-2018-15982, is a use-after-free flaw enabling arbitrary code-execution in Flash. \u201cAdobe has released security updates for Adobe Flash Player for Windows, macOS, Linux and Chrome OS,\u201d Adobe said in its release. \u201cThese updates address one critical vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player and one important vulnerability in Adobe Flash Player installer. Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code-execution and privilege-escalation in the context of the current user respectively.\u201d The flaw was discovered by Chenming Xu and Ed Miles of Gigamon ATR. Researchers also outlined the further technical details about the exploit of the vulnerability. Impacted is Adobe Flash Player Desktop Runtime, Adobe Flash Player for Google Chrome; Adobe Flash Player for Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer 11; all for versions 31.0.0.153 and earlier. Adobe Flash Player Installer versions 31.0.0.108 and earlier is also affected. Users of these impacted products can update to version 32.0.0.101, according to Adobe. Users of Adobe Flash Player Installer can update to version 31.0.0.122. Adobe also patched an important-rated insecure library loading (via DLL hijacking) vulnerability, CVE-2018-15983, that could lead to privilege escalation via Adobe Flash. This is only the latest exploit to hit Adobe Flash \u2013 earlier in June, a zero-day Flash vulnerability was is being exploited in the wild in targeted attacks against Windows users in the Middle East, according to researchers.

Cisco has issued security alerts for 30 vulnerabilities across a range of its products and services, with three being ranked as critical and remotely exploitable. Some 20 different Cisco products contain a vulnerable version of the Apache Struts 2 framework that is currently under active exploitation by miscreants dropping cryptocurrency miner malware on exposed systems. Of these, 18 are not vulnerable to any exploitation vectors for the Struts flaw, Cisco said. Five Cisco products, SocialMiner, Identity Services Engine, Finesse, Unified Contact Centre Enterprise and the Video Distribution Suite for Internet Streaming have received patches for the Struts vulnerability. Cisco's cloud-hosted Network Performance Analysis service is yet to get a Struts update though. A critical flaw in the application programming interface (API) for Cisco's cloud-based Umbrella allowed attackers to view and potentially modify data across multiple organisations using the secure internet gateway service. The vulnerability stems from insufficient authentication configurations for the Umbrella API, and has been patched by Cisco with no user action required. Two high-impact vulnerabilities in the Umbrella Enterprise Roaming Client and Enterprise Roaming Module that could be exploited by attackers to elevate user privileges to Administrator level have also been patched by Cisco. A third critical vulnerability can be exploited to run code remotely on the Cisco RV110W VPN firewall and RV130W and RV215W wireless VPN routers, or freeze the devices in denial of service attacks. Patches for the vulnerability address an improper boundary restriction on input via the Guest user account in the devices' web-based remote management interface, Cisco said. Cisco also patched three high impact vulnerabilities in the above network devices, which could be exploited to remotely execute arbitrary commands and read sensitive information on them. Of the thirty vulnerabilities disclosed, 13 are ranked as high impact.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: security alerts, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: ranked, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: contain, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are not vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have received, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: get, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: ranked, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

With more than 12,000 clients across the world using the company's services, it is hard to establish how many customers' details were exposed in the 'information disclosure vulnerability' found by security researcher Kristian Erik Hermansen. When logging into his local bank, which uses Fiserv's platform, Hermansen learned email alerts for financial transactions were assigned an 'event number', which he successfully predicted were distributed in sequence, according to KrebsOnSecurity. Using this knowledge, the researcher was able to directly view alerts set up by another customer by rewriting the site's code in his browser and sending a request for an altered event number. He was able to view the customer's email address, phone number and bank account number - as well as view and edit alerts they had previously set up. \"I shouldn't be able to see this data,\" he said. \"Anytime you spend money that should be a private transaction between you and your bank, not available for everyone else to see.\" He added a criminal could have exploited the flaw to steal information from customers.  Together with KrebsOnSeceurity author Brian Krebs, Hermansen worked to verify whether or not the flaw was exclusive to his own bank's installation of the platform. They soon discovered hundreds of other Fiserv-affiliated banks may have been just as vulnerable as those they had tested. IT Pro approached Fiserv for comment, and to establish how many institutions in the UK may have been affected, if any, but the company did not respond at the time of writing. A spokesperson told Krebs that Fiserv had responded accordingly, and corrected the issue. \"After receiving your email, we promptly engaged appropriate resources and worked around the clock to research and remediate the situation,\" the spokesperson said. \"We developed a security patch within 24 hours of receiving notification and deployed the patch to clients that utilise a hosted version of the solution.

PC owners and admins will want to upgrade their copies of Flash to version 31.0.0.153 or later in order to get the patch \u2013 or just dump the damn thing all together. The November 20 security update addresses a single flaw, designated CVE-2018-15981. It is a type confusion bug that can be exploited to achieve remote code execution. Basically, an attacker could slip the exploit code into a Flash .swf file, put it on a web page, and covertly install malware on any vulnerable machine that visits the page. Because Adobe does not maintain a fixed patching schedule for Flash Player, this isn't technically considered an out-of-band band-aid. However, the update does come just one week after Adobe pushed out a handful of fixes for Patch Tuesday, including one for an information disclosure vulnerability in Flash Player. That Adobe would post another update just one week after their last patch should underscore that CVE-2018-15981 is a serious enough vulnerability to be a priority fix for users and admins. After installing this latest fix, those who are tired of the constant security threats might also want to consider taking the advice of multiple security experts and developers and at least disable Flash by default if not permanently. The notoriously vulnerable plugin has long since been surpassed by HTML5, and most major websites have already transitioned away from Flash, leaving it only really useful for specific sites and applications. Even Adobe wants to kill off Flash. The Photoshop giant has said that by 2020 it plans to formally retire the plugin once and for all.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has emitted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: upgrade, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: get, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addresses, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: designated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: a fixed patching schedule, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: does come, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: pushed out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: would post, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: installing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The National Cyber Security Centre laid out its new procedure, called the \"Equities Process\" in a blog post that details how it makes decisions on whether to make public the discovery of new flaws. National security operations sometimes hold back from announcing the discovery of security flaws in part because the bugs can be used to gather intelligence. \u201cThere\u2019s got to be a good reason not to disclose,\u201d said Ian Levy, technical director at the NCSC. The default position, the NCSC said, is to disclose those vulnerabilities to the public after fixes have been made. The government will only keep them confidential in rare instances, such as if there\u2019s an overriding intelligence reason. Levy said withholding release of a bug will require high-level government sign-off. The goal is to prevent cyberattacks like \u201cWannaCry,\u201d which paralyzed computer systems around the world in May 2017. The attack, which the U.S. has blamed on North Korea, wrought havoc within the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service (NHS) by exploiting vulnerabilities in an outdated version of Microsoft Windows. WannaCry underscored the dangers of not patching or updating software.  The NCSC\u2019s disclosure policy follows one implemented by the White House in 2017. The National Security Agency (NSA) had come under intense pressure from transparency advocates to disclose more about its work in the wake of WannaCry. \u201cThe best defense against a cyberattack, whether it\u2019s by criminals or nation states, is to keep your box up to date,\u201d said Levy. \u201cIf you patch your software, a lot of the stuff that we\u2019ve found goes away.\u201d The vast majority of attacks are carried out by exploiting vulnerabilities already known to the vendors of the technology in question, Levy said. Such was the case when Russian cyberoperatives hacked into British telecoms companies in 2017. Levy said the primary goal of more transparency is to \u201cbang the drum\u201d about basic cybersecurity, like patching and secure network setups.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: the public disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: make public, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: announcing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclose, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been made, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: cyberattacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: updating, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

His explanations include step-by-step instructions for exploiting the bug. According to the initial details in the disclosure, the issue is present in a shared code base of the virtualization software, available on all supported operating systems. Exploiting the vulnerability allows an attacker to escape the virtual environment of the guest machine and reach the Ring 3 privilege layer, used for running code from most user programs, with the least privileges. Turning one \"overflow\" into another Sergey Zelenyuk found that the security bug can be leveraged on virtual machines configured with the Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM) network adapter in Network Address Translation (NAT) mode, the default setup that allows the guest system to access external networks. \"The [Intel PRO/1000 MT Desktop (82540EM)] has a vulnerability allowing an attacker with root/administrator privileges in a guest to escape to a host ring3. Then the attacker can use existing techniques to escalate privileges to ring 0 via /dev/vboxdrv,\" Zelenyuk writes in a technical write-up on Tuesday. Zelenyuk says that an important aspect in getting how the vulnerability works is to understand that context descriptors are processed before data descriptors. The researcher describes the mechanics behind the security flaw in detail, showing how to trigger the necessary conditions to obtain a buffer overflow that could be abused to escape the confinements of the virtual operating system. First, he caused an integer underflow condition using packet descriptors - data segments that allow the network adapter to track network packet data in the system memory. This state was then leveraged to read data from the guest OS to into a heap buffer and cause an overflow condition that could lead to overwriting function pointers; or to cause a stack overflow condition.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is present, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: Exploiting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: writes, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Samba 4 users should update now. Open source server platform Samba has issued patches for two critical vulnerabilities that could be used to launch denial-of-service attacks or allow anyone to change user and administrator passwords. Samba is a free, open source interoperability suite that extends Windows file and print services to Unix and Linux machines. Businesses that run Unix/Linux and Windows side by side frequently use Samba to link the two operating systems together, making any risk to the security and stability of Samba a serious risk. The vulnerabilities in question, CVE-2018-1050 and CVE-2018-1057, are both serious risks for anyone using Samba. If your business has a Samba implementation it's highly recommended that you install the applicable security updates.  What the Samba vulnerabilities can do The first vulnerability, 1050, affects all Samba instances version 4.0.0 and up. More specifically, it only affects version 4.0.0 and up Samba installations that are also running their Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Spool Subsystem Service (spoolss) as an external daemon (RPC spoolss is configured to internal by default). If the RPC spoolss misses an input sanitization check it can cause the print spooler to crash, effectively killing the ability for anyone using Samba to send files to a printer. The second vulnerability, 1057, is a far greater risk to Samba security. Like 1050, it affects all Samba installations version 4.0.0 and up and allows users to change the passwords of other users, including those with admin rights. 1057's problem stems from a problem with how Samba Active Directory domain controllers handle permission validations using the lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP). \"The LDAP server incorrectly validates certain LDAP password modifications against the 'Change Password' privilege, but then performs a password reset operation,\" Samba said. This vulnerability only affects Samba installations being used as Active Directory domain controllers, so those using Samba in non-domain control roles don't need to be concerned.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addressing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: in question, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Ahead of April's Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has released patches for the critical flaw, which affects Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, or mpengine.dll, the core of Windows Defender in Windows 10. \"An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary code in the security context of the LocalSystem Account and take control of the system,\" warns Microsoft. \"An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\" Google Project Zero researcher Thomas Dullien, aka Halvar Flake, discovered that attackers can trigger a memory-corruption issue in the engine if they can get Windows Defender and other affected security products to scan a specially-crafted file. Microsoft warns there are many ways an attacker could achieve this, including placing the file on a website, in an email or instant message, on any site that hosts files, or in a shared directory. As with similar vulnerabilities reported last year by the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and Project Zero, an attack would be instant if the affected antivirus has real-time protection enabled.  Although the patch is being released before Microsoft's monthly security update, the bug, CVE2018-0986, is not an out-of-band patch as Microsoft updates the engine as needed.

The flaw, dubbed CVE-2018-3110 was given a CVSS base score of 9.9 (out of 10) and Oracle warns that successful exploit of the bug \"can result in complete compromise of the Oracle Database and shell access to the underlying server.\" \"Due to the nature of this vulnerability, Oracle strongly recommends that customers take action without delay,\" Oracle says. Vulnerable versions of Database Server include 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.2, 12.2.0.1, and 18. Admins are advised to install Oracle's update as soon as possible. No credit was given for discovery or reporting. The flaw itself is found in the JavaVM component of Oracle Database Server and is not considered a remote code exploit flaw, as it requires the attacker have a connection to the server via Oracle Net, the protocol Oracle servers use to connect with client applications. Other than that, however, there is little else required for a successful attack that gives complete control over the host server. The Oracle patch will only pile on to what is going to be a busy week for IT departments and administrators. In addition to this fix, Microsoft is releasing its monthly Patch Tuesday security update for Windows, Office, and Internet Explorer/Edge today, and Adobe has posted fixes for security holes in Flash Player, Acrobat/Reader, Creative Cloud, and Experience manager.

The flaw was tied to a bug in the popular in-display fingerprint reader technology used for user authentication. In-display fingerprint reader technology is widely considered an up-and-coming feature to be used in a number of flagship model phones introduced in 2019 by top OEM phone makers, according to Tencent\u2019s Xuanwu Lab which is credited for first identifying the flaw earlier this year. \u201cDuring our research on this, we found all the in-display fingerprint sensor module suffer the same problem no matter where it was manufactured by whatever vendors,\u201d said Yang Yu, a researcher at Xuanwu Lab. \u201cThis vulnerability is a design fault of in-display fingerprint sensors.\u201d Impacted are all phones tested in the first half of 2018 that had in-display fingerprint sensors, said Yu. That includes current models of Huawei Technologies\u2019 Porsche Design Mate RS and Mate 20 Pro model phones. Yu said that many more cellphone manufacturers are impacted by the issue. However, Yu would not specify other impacted vendors or models: \u201cVendors differ greatly in the attitude to security issues, someone have open attitudes, like Huawei, and in contrast, some vendors strongly hope us to keep the voice down on this,\u201d he told Threatpost. He noted Huawei has been forthcoming, issuing patches to address the issue. Other phones that use the feature include Vivo Communication Technology\u2019s V11 Pro, X21 and Nex ; and OnePlus\u2019 6T and Xiaomi Mi 8 Explorer Edition phones. Vivo, OnePlus and Xiaomi did not respond to requests for comment from Threatpost. In-display fingerprint readers based on optical fingerprint imaging, experts believe, will soon replace conventional authentication based on capacitance-sensor fingerprint scanners. In-display readers allow for a user to place a finger on the screen of a smartphone where a scanner from behind the display can verify a fingerprint, authenticate the user and unlock the phone. Design-wise the feature allows phones to be sleeker and less cluttered, supporting infinity displays.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been quietly patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: first identifying, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are impacted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: issuing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Chinese researchers have found 14 security vulnerabilities affecting many models. The ranges affected (some as far back as 2012) are the BMW i Series, X Series, 3 Series, 5 Series and 7 Series, with a total of seven rated serious enough to be assigned CVE numbers. The vulnerabilities are in in the Telematics Control Unit (TCU), the Central Gateway Module, and Head Unit, across a range of interfaces including via GSM, BMW Remote Service, BMW ConnectedDrive, Remote Diagnosis, NGTP, Bluetooth, and the USB/OBD-II interfaces. Some require local access (e.g. via USB) to exploit but six including the Bluetooth flaw were accessible remotely, making them the most serious. Should owners worry that the flaws could be exploited, endangering drivers and vehicles? On the basis of the technical description, that seems unlikely, although Keen Lab won\u2019t release the full proof-of-concept code until 2019. Keen Lab described the effect of its hacking as allowing it to carry out: The execution of arbitrary, unauthorized diagnostic requests of BMW in-car systems remotely. To which BMW responded:     BMW Group has already implemented security measures, which are currently being rolled out via over-the-air configuration updates. Additional security enhancements for the affected infotainment systems are being developed and will be available as software updates for customers. In other words, some fixes have already been made, while others will be made between now and early 2019, potentially requiring a trip to a service centre. Full marks to BMW for promptly responding to the research but the press release issued in its wake reads like PR spin. To most outsiders, this is a case of Chinese white hats finding vulnerabilities in BMW\u2019s in-car systems. To BMW, judging by the triumphant language of its press release, it\u2019s as if this was the plan all along, right down to awarding Keen Lab the \u201cfirst-ever BMW Group Digitalization and IT Research Award.\u201d More likely, car makers are being caught out by the attention their in-car systems are getting from researchers, with Volkswagen Audi Group experiencing some of the same discomfort a couple of weeks ago at the hands of Dutch researchers.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: assigned CVE, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are being developed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: will be available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have already been made, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: will be made, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: finding, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Indeed, patches that fix security vulnerabilities often end up giving away enough about the vulnerability that both good guys and bad guys alike can weaponise it from first principles \u2013 all without having to figure out the vulnerability in the first place. In the August 2018 case, dubbed CVE-2018-14847, a crook could trick an unpatched Microtik router into coughing up the contents of any file on the device, including the password file. Worse still, the password file included plaintext passwords, with no salting, hashing or stretching, meaning that a security bypass bug could be parlayed into a credential compromise.  The perils of late patching What we didn\u2019t know back then was that security researchers at Tenable had responsibly disclosed another bunch of Mikrotik router bugs at about the same time. These bugs were serious \u2013 indeed, one of them allows a attacker to run any program of their choosing, just by making a web request to the router. This sort of hole is known, for rather obvious reasons, as an RCE, short for Remote Code Execution. Tenable\u2019s bugs, however, were what\u2019s known as \u201cauthenticated vulnerabilities\u201d, meaning that you had to be logged in first in order to be able to exploit them. Security holes that require pre-authentication may seem harmless at first sight \u2013 after all, if you already have a username and password, or some other access token, that gives you access to a system\u2026 \u2026well, you\u2019re already in, so it sounds as though breaking in again can be dismissed as an irrelevancy. The good news is that Mikrotik has already patched Tenable\u2019s now-disclosed bugs, dubbed CVE-2018-1156, -1157, -1158 and -1159. Make sure you have the latest Mikrotik firmware updates, which are: 6.40.9, 6.42.7 or 6.43, depending on whether you\u2019re using the current, previous or pre-previous version.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: had responsibly disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has already patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

This month, Microsoft fixed security flaws in Microsoft Windows, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, ChakraCore, .NET Framework, Microsoft Exchange Server, Windows Host Compute Service Shim, and Microsoft Office and Microsoft Office Services and Web Apps.  Microsoft patches two zero-days The biggest issue patched this month is a zero-day in Internet Explorer that has been abused by a cyber-espionage campaign earlier this month. The zero-day (CVE-2018-8174) affects not only IE but also any other projects that embed the IE web rendering engine. Microsoft credited researchers from both Qihoo 360 Core Security and Kaspersky Lab for discovering this issue. The second zero-day is CVE-2018-8120, an elevation-of-privilege vulnerability in the Win32k component. \"An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights,\" Microsoft says. But the flaw is not as dangerous as it sounds, as an attacker already needs a foothold on Windows systems to run his malicious code in the first place, to elevate his access rights. Microsoft also patched CVE-2018-8141 (Windows Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability) and CVE-2018-8170 (Windows Image Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability), for which exploitation details became public. Despite info about these two flaws being published online, Microsoft says none were exploited in the wild.  Flash fixes also included Last but not least, the Microsoft May 2018 Patch Tuesday also included a patch for an Adobe Flash Player vulnerability (CVE-2018-4944) that Adobe patched earlier today.

The vulnerability, CVE-2018-11235, was addressed and fixed in Git 2.17.1 and Git for Windows 2.17.1 (2), which were both released today. In addition, the Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) team has blocked malicious repositories from being pushed to VSTS to ensure that Visual Studio cannot be used as a vector for transmitting malicious repositories to clients who have not yet patched their clients. The vulnerability is caused when repositories are cloned. When cloning a repository, Git checks out the parent repository into the working directory as it prepares to clone the submodule. Then, Git realizes that it does not need to perform the clone of submodule because the submodule\u2019s repository already exists on the disk from when it was checked in to the parent, and then was written to the working directory when the parent repository was checked out. According to Microsoft, the problem lies in the fact that when Git repositories are cloned, there are important configuration details not obtained from the server, such as hooks, which are scripts that can be run at certain points in the Git workflow.  The configuration is not cloned from a remote server because that would lead to a vulnerability where remote servers could provide code that would be executed on the end user\u2019s computer. Unfortunately, with the new vulnerability, that is exactly what happens, Microsoft explained. Because the submodule\u2019s repository is checked in to a parent repository, it is not actually cloned. Therefore, the submodule repository can already have a hook configured. Additionally, if a user recursively cloned a malicious parent repository, it first checks out the parent, reads the submodule\u2019s checked-in repository and prepares to write that submodule to the working directory, then it executes post-checkout hooks, Microsoft explained. In order to eliminate this vulnerability, submodule\u2019s folder names are examined more closely by Git clients. Now, submodule folder names can no longer contain \u201c..\u201d as a path segment and they cannot be symbolic links. As a result, they now will have to be within the .git repository folder instead of in the actual repository\u2019s working directory.

The security hole, CVE-2018-11235, reported by Etienne Stalmans, stems from a flaw in Git whereby sub-module names supplied by the .gitmodules file are not properly validated when appended to $GIT_DIR/modules. Including \"../\" in a name could result in directory hopping. Post-checkout hooks could then be executed, potentially causing all manner of mayhem to ensue on the victim's system.

In a change from normal programming, the vulnerability appears to be cross platform. Fear not, however, because a patch is available. The Git team released the update in 2.13.7 of the popular coding, collaboration and control tool and forward-ported it to versions 2.14.4, 2.15.2, 2.16.4 and 2.13.7.

This was confirmed by Trustwave\u2019s security researcher Manuel Nader, and the VPN provider itself. One of the two vulnerabilities were fixed in the meantime, while the other one remains active, and PureVPN has, according to Nader, \u201caccepted the risk\u201d. The vulnerability that was patched saw saved passwords stored in plaintext, on this location: 'C:\\ProgramData\\purevpn\\config\\login.conf All users have had the chance to access and read the file by simply opening it through the CMD. This vulnerability has been patched in the version 6.1.0. and whoever uses PureVPN is strongly advised to update to the latest version, as soon as possible.  The second vulnerability is the one that remains open, and the company has decided to \u2018accept the risk\u2019. So basically, you\u2019d need to open the Windows client, open Configuration, User Profile, and click on \u2018Show Password\u2019. A spokesperson for PureVPN sent us the following statement. \"This is not a vulnerability rather a feature that we deployed for ease of our users. Back in April 2018, when Trustwave reported it to us, we assessed the risk, and found it minimally due to how our systems are designed. Our systems work a bit different than most of the other VPN providers. For enhanced security, we use separate passwords for Member Area and VPN access. Member Area password which is more privileged is not shown in apps, it's the VPN access password that is the subject of this feature. Furthermore, by default, our VPN passwords are system generated and not set by users. This curtails the risk of users using the same password for VPN accounts that they use for their sensitive accounts elsewhere on the Internet. On the other hand, this enhanced security design proved a little difficult for quite a few of our users and hence we offered a way for them to easily retrieve their VPN password. For now the community has raised concerns and is confusing it as a vulnerability, we have temporarily removed the feature and released a newer version 6.2.2.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was confirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: accept the risk, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

You should, because it was only a few months ago, when the CTS Labs security company revealed numerous vulnerabilities in AMD's new Ryzen and EPYC processor lines. AMD has been largely quiet about these vulnerabilities in the time since, but the company assured Tom's Hardware that it hasn't forgotten about CTS Labs' report or neglected to address the flaws in its processors. A quick recap: In March, CTS Labs released information on a collection of vulnerabilities in AMD's latest chips that it dubbed \"Ryzenfall.\" These security flaws were said to be present in the most basic aspects of the Ryzen and EPYC processors, and after consulting with other researchers, CTS Labs decided to publish its findings without giving AMD the customary 90-day notice between a vulnerability's discovery and its public disclosure. Earlier this week, CTS Labs emailed us to express concern about the lack of updates from AMD regarding these vulnerabilities. The company said it believed many of the vulnerabilities would take months to fix, with the Chimera issues requiring a hardware change that couldn't be implemented in products that have already shipped. AMD's relative silence and lack of updates apparently led CTS Labs to believe the company had stalled out.  We reached out to AMD for comment and received the following in response: Within approximately 30 days of being notified by CTS Labs, AMD released patches to our ecosystem partners mitigating all of the CTS identified vulnerabilities on our EPYC\u2122 platform as well as patches mitigating Chimera across all AMD platforms. These patches are in final testing with our ecosystem partners in advance of being released publicly.  We remain on track to begin releasing patches to our ecosystem partners for the other products identified in the report this month.  We expect these patches to be released publicly as our ecosystem partners complete their validation work.  That's still vague--we don't know to what \"ecosystem partners\" these patches have been delivered nor when they should be expected to roll out--but it does show that AMD hasn't simply forgotten about CTS Labs' report. We expect to hear more about these patches and how AMD plans to address them as the company and its partners get them ready to ship. In the meantime, it seems that much like the sky, Ryzen has yet to fall.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: released information, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be present in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: publish, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: a vulnerability's discovery, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: its public disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the lack of updates, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: lack of updates, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being notified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: mitigating, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: mitigating, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being released publicly, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: begin releasing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be released publicly, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been delivered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: plans to address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The vulnerability \u2013 CVE-2018-11776 \u2013 affects core code and allows miscreants to pull off remote code execution against vulnerable servers and websites. It affects all versions of Struts 2, the popular open-source framework for Java web apps. The Apache Software Foundation has \"urgently advised\" anyone using Struts to update to the latest version immediately, noting that the last time a critical hole was found, the holes were being exploited in the wild just a day later. In other words, if you delay in patching, your organization will be compromised in short order via this bug, if you are running vulnerable systems. It was that earlier flaw that led to a nightmare data breach from credit company Equifax after it failed to patch swiftly enough. The details of nearly 150 million people were exposed, costing the company more than $600m, so this is not something to be taken lightly. The company that discovered the vulnerability \u2013 Semmle Security Research Team \u2013 warns that this latest one is actually worse that the one last year, which it also found. It has published a blog post with more information. Semmle found the hole back in April and reported it to Apache, which put out a patch in June that it has now pulled into formal updates (2.3.35 for those using version 2.3 and 2.5.17 for those on 2.5). As mentioned, the vulnerability is in the core code and doesn't require additional plugins to work. It is caused by insufficient validation of untrusted user data in the core of the Struts framework, and can be exploited in several different ways.

Since it can be used remotely and due to the fact that Struts is typically used to create applications that are on the public internet, hackers are going to be especially focused on exploiting it so they can gain access to corporate networks.

A vulnerability in the VBScript engine allowed for a zero-day exploit to infect machines by opening specially crafted scripts that can corrupt memory leading to the opportunity for arbitrary code execution. In a web-based attack, specially designed web pages could exploit the same vulnerability when using Internet Explorer. Embedding AcitveX controls that were marked \"safe for initialization\" inside of a Microsoft Office document also allowed for unsafe code to be executed since the IE rendering engine is used. One of the more interesting parts of the attack is that it does not matter what a user's default browser is. When using VBScript, it is possible to force a web page to be loaded using Internet Explorer even if Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Opera or another browser is set to default. This particular vulnerability has been found in use and affects Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 and newer. Kasperksy Lab has provided a fairly detailed analysis of how the exploit functions. In short, a statement from their security researchers says it all. \"We expect this vulnerability to become one of the most exploited in the near future, as it won\u2019t be long until exploit kit authors start abusing it in both drive-by (via browser) and spear-phishing (via document) campaigns.\" In addition to the VBScript flaw discovered and patched, Microsoft has also patched a privilege escalation vulnerability. A failure of the Win32k component allows for arbitrary code to be executed in kernel mode. This allows for a standard user account to obtain full system access, although it should be noted that a user must be logged in already to perform the exploit. In this case, both exploits have been patched but that does not mean end users and administrators are going to patch their systems in a timely manner. It is advised to manually check for updates to verify that all of the latest patches are installed. In total, 67 updates were issued solving 21 critically rated vulnerabilities.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: spear-phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has also patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: are going to patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

And the bug, CVE-2018-1002105, aka the Kubernetes privilege escalation flaw, is a doozy. It's a CVSS 9.8 critical security hole. With a specially crafted network request, any user can establish a connection through the Kubernetes application programming interface (API) server to a backend server. Once established, an attacker can send arbitrary requests over the network connection directly to that backend. Adding insult to injury, these requests are authenticated with the Kubernetes API server's Transport Layer Security (TLS) credentials. Worse still, \"In default configurations, all users (authenticated and unauthenticated) are allowed to perform discovery API calls that allow this escalation.\" So, yes, anyone who knows about this hole can take command of your Kubernetes cluster. Oh, and for the final jolt of pain: \"There is no simple way to detect whether this vulnerability has been used. Because the unauthorized requests are made over an established connection, they do not appear in the Kubernetes API server audit logs or server log. The requests do appear in the kubelet or aggregated API server logs, but are indistinguishable from correctly authorized and proxied requests via the Kubernetes API server.\" In other words, Red Hat said, \"The privilege escalation flaw makes it possible for any user to gain full administrator privileges on any compute node being run in a Kubernetes pod. This is a big deal. Not only can this actor steal sensitive data or inject malicious code, but they can also bring down production applications and services from within an organization's firewall.\" The only real fix is to upgrade Kubernetes. Any program, which includes Kubernetes, is vulnerable. Kubernetes distributors are already releasing fixes. Red Hat reports all its \"Kubernetes-based services and products -- including Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform, Red Hat OpenShift Online, and Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated -- are affected.\" Red Hat has begun delivering patches and service updates to affected users.

Researchers from cybersecurity firm Tenable disclosed the bug, which has been assigned as CVE-2018-1149. The vulnerability cannot get much more serious, as it allows attackers to remotely execute code in the software, the researchers said in a security advisory on Monday. Nuuo, describing itself as a provider of \"trusted video management\" software, offers a range of video solutions for surveillance systems in industries including transport, banking, government, and residential areas. Dubbed \"Peekaboo,\" the zero-day stack buffer overflow vulnerability, when exploited, allows threat actors to view and tamper with video surveillance recordings and feeds. It is also possible to use the bug to steal data including credentials, IP addresses, port usage, and the make & models of connected surveillance devices. Such a security vulnerability has wide-reaching, real-world consequences -- as criminals could compromise a surveillance camera feed, replace the footage with a static image, and raid a premises, for example. In addition, the bug could be used to fully disable cameras and surveillance products. Peekaboo specifically impacts the NVRMini 2 NAS and network video recorder, which acts as a hub for connected surveillance products. When exploited, the product permitted access to the control management system (CMS) interface, which further exposes credentials of all connected video surveillance cameras connected to the storage system. Speaking to ZDNet, Gavin Millard, VP of threat intelligence at Tenable, said that organizations all over the world use Nuuo software, including in shopping centers, hospitals, banks, and public areas. However, therein lies the problem -- as the software is also white labeled to over 100 brands and 2,500 camera product lines.  Tenable disclosed the zero-day vulnerability to Nuuo. A patch has not been released, but Nuuo is currently developing a fix for deployment. A plugin has also been released by Tenable for organizations to assess whether or not they are vulnerable to Peekaboo. ZDNet has reached out to Nuuo and will update if we hear back.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: present in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: impact, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: impacts, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has not been released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: is currently developing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has also been released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: are vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

This Carnegie-Mellon CERT vulnerability advisory on Monday laid out the cryptographic flaw: firmware or operating system drivers skip a vital check during a Diffie-Hellman key exchange between devices. The impact: a nearby eavesdropper could \u201cintercept and decrypt and/or forge and inject device messages\u201d carried over Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) wireless connections between gizmos. In other words, you can potentially snoop on supposedly encrypted communications between two devices to steal their info going over the air, and inject malicious commands. To pull this off, you must have been within radio range and transmitting while the gadgets were initially pairing. The bug's status in Android is confusing: while it doesn't appear in the operating system project's July monthly bulletin, phone and tablet manufacturers like LG and Huawei list the bug as being patched in the, er, July security update. Microsoft has declared itself in the clear. The CERT note says fixes are needed both in software and firmware, which should be obtained from manufacturers and developers, and installed \u2013 if at all possible. We're guessing for random small-time Bluetooth gizmos, it won't be very easy to prise an update out of the vendors, although you should have better luck with bigger brand gear. So, make sure you're patched via the usual software update mechanisms, or just look out for nearby snoops, and be ready to thwart them, when pairing devices. Manufacturers were warned in January, it appears, so have had plenty of time to work on solutions. Indeed, silicon vendor patches for CVE-2018-5383 are already rolling out among larger gadget and device makers, with Lenovo and Dell posting updates in the past month or so. Linux versions prior to 3.19 don't support Bluetooth LE Secure Connections and are therefore not vulnerable, we're told.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been made public, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: laid out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: being patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: rolling out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: posting updates, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Now Google\u2019s Project Zero team of security researchers are disclosing yet another Windows 10 security flaw that Microsoft has again failed to patch before Google\u2019s imposed 90-day period. Neowin spotted that Google reported two bugs to Microsoft in November, but the company only addressed one of them with its recent Patch Tuesday fixes. The latest unpatched issue is an Elevation of Privilege which allows a normal user to gain administrator privileges on a system. Microsoft has rated the flaw as \u201cimportant,\u201d but not \u201ccritical\u201d as it can\u2019t be exploited remotely. It\u2019s still an important issue to fix, as an attacker could potentially combine this with a separate unknown remote code execution to gain administrator access, although that\u2019s an unlikely scenario unless Microsoft doesn\u2019t address it promptly. It\u2019s not clear when Microsoft intends to address the latest security flaw in Windows 10, and the company still needs to solve the Edge vulnerability that was disclosed by Google earlier this week. Microsoft hit back at Google\u2019s approach to security patches last year, after discovering a Chrome flaw and \u201cresponsibly\u201d disclosed it to Google so the company had enough time to patch. Google\u2019s policy to disclose after 90 days without a patch is often criticized and applauded in equal measure. There\u2019s plenty of evidence to suggest security vulnerabilities are increasing in Windows and across the industry, and Microsoft has clearly struggled to fix these two issues with plenty of notice. It can also be argued that Google is making rival software more secure with its efforts, making everyone\u2019s software secure. However, Google also has competitive commercial interests, and Project Zero has been unusually aggressive in finding and publishing new vulnerabilities. Reports suggest Google\u2019s Project Zero security team originated from the fallout around the 2009 Google hack, an intrusion blamed on an unpatched flaw in Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer 6 browser. Google makes exceptions to its strict rules, with grace periods, and can even disclose much sooner if the vulnerability is being actively exploited. Google disclosed a major Windows bug back in 2016 just 10 days after reporting it to Microsoft, and the company has revealed zero-day bugs in Windows in the past before patches are available.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: failed to patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: are disclosing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: failed to patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has rated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: solve, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovering, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: \u201cresponsibly\u201d disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclose, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reporting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The zero-day bug \u2014 CVE-2018-8453 \u2014 affects Windows versions 7, 8.1, 10 and Server 2008, 2012, 2016 and 2019. According to security firm Ivanti, an attacker first needs to log into the operating system, but then can exploit this vulnerability to gain administrator privileges. Another vulnerability patched on Tuesday \u2014 CVE-2018-8423 \u2014 was publicly disclosed last month along with sample exploit code. This flaw involves a component shipped on all Windows machines and used by a number of programs, and could be exploited by getting a user to open a specially-crafted file \u2014 such as a booby-trapped Microsoft Office document. KrebsOnSecurity has frequently suggested that Windows users wait a day or two after Microsoft releases monthly security updates before installing the fixes, with the rationale that occasionally buggy patches can cause serious headaches for users who install them before all the kinks are worked out. This month, Microsoft briefly paused updates for Windows 10 users after many users reported losing all of the files in their \u201cMy Documents\u201d folder. The worst part? Rolling back to previous saved versions of Windows prior to the update did not restore the files. Microsoft appears to have since fixed the issue, but these kinds of incidents illustrate the value of not only waiting a day or two to install updates but also manually backing up your data prior to installing patches (i.e., not just simply counting on Microsoft\u2019s System Restore feature to save the day should things go haywire). Mercifully, Adobe has spared us an update this month for its Flash Player software, although it has shipped a non-security update for Flash.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: vulnerability patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was publicly disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: releases, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: paused, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have since fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: these kinds of incidents, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has spared, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has shipped, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Utilizing old-fashioned social engineering, inventive hackers could forge transaction data and use it to trick support staff into crediting their account manually with extra XMR. By simply copying a line of code from Monero\u2019s wallet \u2013 which is open-sourced and accessible to everyone \u2013 the attackers could manipulate the amounts shown by the wallet when facilitating transactions between addresses. The good thing is that the flaw has since been patched (in Monero at least, it is not entirely clear if this is the case for other Monero-based coins). The more concerning part is that it is only one out of six vulnerabilities disclosed by Monero in the last 24 hours alone, according to information from its HackerOne bug bounty program. Other bugs included a Denial of Service attack vector that could\u2019ve been abused to clog the Monero blockchain and a Python script exploit that made it possible to take down active nodes on the network. Just like the wallet flaw, all of these vulnerabilities have already been fixed. This is not the first time researchers have found kinks in the anonymous cryptocurrency\u2019s code \u2013 but to Monero\u2019s credit, its dev team has always made sure to address such concerns appropriately.

AMD is addressing several vulnerabilities discovered in its Ryzen and EPYC chips, and rolling out updates for millions of devices \"in the coming weeks.\" The 13 vulnerabilities came to public attention clouded in controversy. The security company CTS Labs gave AMD less than 24 hours notice before releasing the information to the public. Standard vulnerability disclosure practices call for giving companies at least 90 days' notice so they can fix the flaws before researchers go public and hackers can start causing trouble. Had CTS Labs given AMD that same courtesy, the issues would have been addressed within a week of the notification. \"Each of the issues cited can be mitigated through firmware patches and a standard BIOS update, which we plan to release in the coming weeks,\" said Sarah Youngbauer, AMD's senior spokeswoman. \"We believe this provides a good example of why the more standard 90-day notification window for such notifications exist.\"  In the original vulnerability report, CTS Labs said that it would take \"several months\" to fix the issues and that some hardware flaws \"cannot be fixed.\" AMD disagreed with that timeline, and said it would provide more information in several weeks. The chipmaker said the issues were not with its hardware, but with firmware, or software that's embedded in hardware. It'll be sending fixes for all 13 vulnerabilities through patches and BIOS updates. According to AMD's technical assessment, each of the flaws required administrative access. \"Any attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research,\" Papermaster said in a statement. Critics also took issue with another aspect of the CTS Labs report, pointing out the legal disclaimer on the company's website: \"You are advised that we may have, either directly or indirectly, an economic interest in the performance of the securities of the companies whose products are the subject of our reports.\"   Last Wednesday, CTS Labs' chief financial officer and co-founder, Yaron Luk-Zilberman, a former hedge fund manager, said it didn't have \"any investment (long or short) in Intel or AMD.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: will arrive, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: the reported flaws, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is addressing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: rolling out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: came to public, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: can fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: go public, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: mitigated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: the original vulnerability report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: cannot be fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be sending, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

In a blog post authored by AMD\u2019s chief technical officer, Mark Papermaster, AMD confirmed that the four broad classifications of attacks\u2014Masterkey, Ryzenfall, Fallout, and Chimera\u2014are viable, though they require administrative access to the PC or server in question. Third-party protection, such as Microsoft Windows Credential Guard, also serve to block unauthorized administrative access, Papermaster wrote. In any event, \u201cany attacker gaining unauthorized administrative access would have a wide range of attacks at their disposal well beyond the exploits identified in this research,\u201d AMD\u2019s Papermaster added. But AMD also provided the answer to consumers\u2019 most pressing question: What, if anything, needs to be done? For each of the first three classifications of vulnerabilities, AMD said it is working on firmware updates that the company plans to release during the coming weeks. The fourth category of vulnerability, known as Chimera, affected the Promontory chipset, which CTS-Labs said was designed with logic supplied by ASMedia, a third-party vendor. While AMD said patches for that will also be released via a BIOS update, the company said it is working with the Promontory chipset maker on developing the mitigations, rather than supplying its own. AMD has neither confirmed nor denied whether the attacks can be executed remotely, or require local access. AMD did deny, however, that the attacks have anything to do with Meltdown or Spectre, the two side-channel attacks that rival Intel has worked to patch. About a week ago, CTS-Labs issued a press release as well as a website outlining the vulnerabilities, which the company provided to AMD less than 24 hours before CTS-Labs went public, AMD said. But CTS-Labs also drew fire over boilerplate copy on its website that implied a potential financial interest in the subjects of its reports. PCWorld attempted to interview CTS executives, but later rescinded that request after CTS-Labs representatives demanded a list of questions in advance, and also forbade us from asking about the timing and the company\u2019s financial motivations.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has acknowledged, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: can be patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: will also be released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: developing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Researcher Rafay Baloch on Monday disclosed two proof-of-concepts revealing how vulnerabilities in Edge browser 42.17134.1.0 and Safari iOS 11.3.1 could be abused to manipulate the browsers\u2019 address bars, tricking victims into thinking they are visiting a legitimate website. Baloch told Threatpost Wednesday that Apple has promised to fix the flaw in its next security update for Safari. \u201cApple has told [me] that the latest beta of iOS 12 also addresses the issue, however they haven\u2019t provided any dates,\u201d he said. Apple did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Threatpost. Microsoft for its part has fixed the vulnerability Baloch found in the Edge browser, (CVE-2018-8383) in its August Patch Tuesday release. According to Microsoft\u2019s vulnerability advisory released August 14, the spoofing flaw exists because Edge does not properly parse HTTP content. Both flaws stem from the Edge and Safari browsers allowing JavaScript to update the address bar while the page is still loading. This means that an attacker could request data from a non-existent port and, due to the delay induced by the setInterval function, trigger the address bar spoofing. The browser would then preserve the address bar and load the content from the spoofed page, Baloch said in his blog breaking down both vulnerabilities. From there, the attacker could spoof the website, using it to lure in victims and potentially gather credentials or spread malware. For instance, the attacker could send an email message containing the specially crafted URL to the user, convince the user to click it, and take them to the link which could gather their credentials or sensitive information. \u201cAs per Google, Address bar is the only reliable indicator for ensuring the identity of the website, if the Address bar points to Facebook.com and the content is hosted on attacker\u2019s website, there is no reason why someone would not fall for this,\u201d Baloch told Threatpost.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: spoof, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: has yet to be patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has yet issue, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addresses, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: advisory released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: spoof, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: send, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

The Safari proof-of-concept is similar, except for one constraint where it does not allow users to type their information into the input boxes while the page is in a loading state. However, Bolach said he was able to circumvent this restriction by injecting a fake keyboard using Javascript \u2013 a common practice in banking sites. No other browsers \u2013 including Chrome or Firefox \u2013 were discovered to have the flaw, said Baloch. Baloch is known for discovering similar vulnerabilities in Chrome, Firefox and other major browsers in 2016, which also allowed attackers to spoof URLs in the address bar.

It expects the mainnet launch to stay on schedule. Qihoo 360, a China-based internet security firm, says it has notified the EOS blockchain project about \u201ca series of epic vulnerabilities\u201d discovered on its platform. The firm said in a Tuesday report that loopholes found in the EOS platform could expose nodes on the network to attackers, giving them the ability to execute code remotely and take \u201cfull control\u201d of transactions. The firm claims that such an attack could potentially \u201cdecimate\u201d the entire cryptocurrency network. Qihoo 360 went on to explain that bad actors would be able to attack the network by constructing and publishing smart contracts containing malicious code on the EOS mainnet and have EOS supernodes pack them into new blocks. Subsequently the code would affect all nodes on the network, including those of cryptocurrency wallets and exchanges, letting the attackers gain control of private keys to cryptocurrency transactions. While EOS has not yet made any public comment on the issue, Qihoo 360 said in another blog update that the project\u2019s lead developer, Daniel Larimer, was notified of the issues and that he has since said the vulnerabilities \u2013 identified as issue number 3498 on Github \u2013 have been fixed. \u201cIf any of these asserts trigger in release it shouldn\u2019t pass, but should throw.

The PDF apps have received a major update that includes dozens of fixes for flaws that would allow for remote code execution attacks if exploited. Other possible attacks include elevation of privilege flaws and information disclosure vulnerabilities. Fortunately, Adobe said that none of the bugs was currently being targeted in the wild - yet. For Mac and Windows Acrobat/Reader DC users, the fixes will be present in versions 2019.008.20071. For those using the older Acrobat and Reader 2017 versions, the fix will be labeled 2017.011.30105. Because PDF readers have become such a popular target for email and web-based malware attacks, users and admins alike would do well to test and install the updates as soon as possible. Exploit-laden PDFs have for more than a decade proven to be one of the most reliable ways to put malware on someone's machine. In total, Adobe credited 19 different researchers with discovering and reporting the vulnerabilities. Among the more prolific bug hunters were Omri Herscovici of CheckPoint Software, who was credited for finding and reporting 35 CVE-listed bugs, and Ke Liu and Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab, who was credited with finding 11 of the patched Adobe vulnerabilities. Beihang University's Lin Wang was given credit for nine vulnerabilities.

But arguably one of the most important factors is in security. These chips are the first generation of new desktop CPUs to come with hardware fixes for the Spectre and Meltdown bugs which emerged in recent years. In particular, it\u2019s the new K-series of gaming CPUs that are receiving the fix. Those chips come with changes at the hardware level and should be far more secure against the kind of attacks that Spectre and its ilk have brought to light in recent years. Although they are still based on the same 14nm node that has dominated Intel\u2019s chip designs since 2014, these would be the first ones to come with a fix for these sorts of bugs at the hardware level. The second set of new 9th-gen chips, the X-series (and Xeon-class chips), don\u2019t have those same security fixes. Because they\u2019re based on the older Skylake-X architecture, Intel is relying solely on software updates to keep them protected against these possible vulnerabilities. News of the fixes were shared at Intel\u2019s recent desktop press event, where it stated that, \u201cthe new desktop processors include protections for the security vulnerabilities commonly referred to as \u2018Spectre,\u2019 \u2018Meltdown,\u2019 and \u2018L1TF.\u2019 These protections include a combination of the hardware design changes we announced earlier this year as well as software and microcode updates.\u201d The hardware alterations made to the chips protect against Meltdown V3, otherwise known as the rogue data cache load bug. The L1 terminal fault exploit was also shored up with hardware changes. Software and microcode changes protect those same chips against the Spectre V2 branch target injection bug, the Meltdown V3, a rogue system register read, and the variant V4 speculative store bypass flaw. In the laptop world, Intel has had a similar approach toward making hardware-level fixes. Some, but not all, have implemented hardware protections. Intel has been criticized in the past for the way it has handled these potentially critical flaws and has had a relatively slow move toward patching the vulnerabilities on a hardware level throughout 2018.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: come with, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: are receiving, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: come with, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: don\u2019t have, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: protected against, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The flaw, tracked as CVE-2018-0296, was detailed in an advisory on June 6 and affects Cisco ASA Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software. \"Cisco strongly recommends that customers upgrade to a fixed software release to remediate this issue,\" Omar Santos of Cisco's Product Security Incident Response Team warned on June 22. The attacks follow the publication of proof-of-concept exploits for the flaw. Santos notes that a unauthenticated, remote attacker could cause a device to reload unexpectedly and cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.   Additionally, an exploit could cause a DoS or unauthenticated disclosure of information. However, Santos said: \"Only a denial-of-service condition (device reload) has been observed by Cisco.\" Cisco has also updated the advisory for CVE-2018-0296 with details about the attacks. The researcher who found the flaw, Micha\u0142 Bentkowski from Polish security firm Securitum, gave a brief description of the root cause in a tweet shortly after Cisco disclosed the bug. Bentkowsky reported the issue to Cisco as a way to use directory-traversal techniques to disclose information to an unauthenticated attacker. Cisco labeled its primary impact as a DoS condition, but said it is possible that on certain releases of ASA a device reload would not occur, yet still allow an attacker to use directory-traversal techniques to view sensitive system information. Bleeping Computer identified two proof-of-concept exploits for CVE-2018-0296 on GitHub. One attempts to extract user names from Cisco ASA. The other states: \"If the web server is vulnerable, the script will dump in a text file both the content of the current directory, files in +CSCOE+ and active sessions.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: install, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: tracked as, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: upgrade, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: remediate, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: warned, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: notes, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has also updated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: identified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: extract, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

As per an official announcement by the company, the latest patch will address issues in Adobe Flash Player 29.0.0.171 and other earlier versions. The vulnerabilities, according to Adobe, are being used by hackers to embed malicious content distributed via email. Security firm Icebrg on Thursday announced that a zero-day vulnerability has led to exploitation in Adobe Flash specifically targeted towards users in the Middle East. The vulnerability (CVE-2018-5002) enables attackers to execute certain actions by executing code on the victims' computers. As per the blog post, the exploit uses a Microsoft Office document for the attack. To circumvent the fact that Adobe Flash is blocked on most browsers, the exploit involves loading Flash Player from within Microsoft Office. The flaw was reported by Icebrg in collaboration with Qihoo 360 Core Security. \"While this attack leveraged a zero-day exploit, individual attacker actions do not happen in isolation. There are several other behavioural aspects that can be used for detection. Any single observable might be low confidence but multiple observables clustered might be indicative of suspicious or malicious activity,\" said Icebrg staff in its blog post. Of course, this is not the first instance wherein Flash Player's vulnerabilities have been exploited. Back in October last year, the company had issued a security patch to fix a critical leak. Users have been strongly recommended to update Adobe Flash in order to avoid any such vulnerabilities seeping into your machines. The update, however, is not a guarantee towards protection against future discrepancies. It is thus advised to enable flash on only a secondary browser that is not used majorly on the computer.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: plug, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: will address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: announced, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: been exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: had issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

That\u2019s a use-after-free flaw enabling arbitrary code-execution in Flash.  The addressed critical vulnerabilities are myriad this month. The arbitrary code-execution problems include: two buffer errors; two untrusted pointer dereference glitches; three heap-overflow issues, five out-of-bounds write flaws, 24 use-after-free bugs. Adobe also patched three other critical-rated issues that could lead to privilege escalation; these are all security bypass problems.

The highest-severity flaw (CVE-2018-2913) lies in the Monitoring Manager component of Oracle GoldenGate, which is the company\u2019s comprehensive software package that allows data to be replicated in heterogeneous data environments. According to the National Vulnerability Database, the glitch is an easily exploitable vulnerability that allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via the TCP protocol to compromise Oracle GoldenGate. The flaw was discovered by Jacob Baines, a researcher with Tenable. \u201cCVE-2018-2913 is a stack buffer overflow in GoldenGate Manager,\u201d Baines told Threatpost. \u201cThe Manager listens on port 7809 where it accepts GoldenGate Software Command Interface (GGSCI) commands. Tenable found that a remote unauthenticated attacker can trigger a stack buffer overflow by sending a GGSCI command that is longer than expected.\u201d The attack is not complex and a bad actor could be remote and unauthenticated. Making matters worse, an attacker could compromise other products after initially attacking GoldenGate, the advisory warned. \u201cWhile the vulnerability is in Oracle GoldenGate, attacks may significantly impact additional products,\u201d the note said. \u201cSuccessful attacks of this vulnerability can result in takeover of Oracle GoldenGate.\u201d The flaw impacts versions 12.1.2.1.0, 12.2.0.2.0, and 12.3.0.1.0 in Oracle GoldenGate.

This security bulletin released by Foxit provides details on the extensive list of vulnerabilities, which were discovered via internal research, end user reports, and reports from research teams. More than 118 issues were addressed, though there was some overlap, and so the number of actual bugs was lower. Vulnerable versions are 9.2.0.9297 and earlier, and only affect Windows users. A significant number of flaws were classed as \u2018critical\u2019 and could allow for remote code execution \u2013 18 were reported by Cisco Talos, all of which were dubbed high in severity. Several were use-after-free flaws, which allows memory to be accessed after it has been freed and can enable hackers to execute arbitrary code and take over the system. Cisco Talos wrote in a report: \u201cThere are a couple of different ways an adversary could leverage this attack including tricking a user to opening a specially crafted, malicious PDF or, if the browser plugin is enabled, the user could trigger the exploit by viewing the document in a web browser.\u201d Foxit told The Daily Swig that its programs were embedded with security features designed to protect its users from malicious actors.

Larry Cashdollar, a bug-hunter at Akamai, explained late last week how the security shortcoming, designated CVE-2018-9206, allows a miscreant to upload and execute arbitrary code as root on a website that uses the vulnerable code with the Apache web server. This would potentially allow an attacker to, among other things, upload and run a webshell to execute commands on the target machine to steal data, change files, distribute malware, and so on. Cashdollar \u2013 real name, he swears \u2013 was able to track the flaw down to Sebastian Tschan's open-source jQuery File Upload tool, and got the developer to fix it in version 9.22.1. The flaw stems from a change to the Apache web server, from version 2.3.9 and onwards, that disabled support for .htaccess security configuration files, which left projects like jQuery File Upload open to exploitation. Additionally, Cashdollar noted, it is almost certain he was not the first person to come across this simple vulnerability. Demonstration videos on YouTube suggest similar flaws are known to miscreants, and have been targeted in some circles for years. \"The internet relies on many security controls every day in order to keep our systems, data, and transactions safe and secure,\" Cashdollar said. \"If one of these controls suddenly doesn't exist it may put security at risk unknowingly to the users and software developers relying on them.\" So, it's believed hackers have been quietly exploiting the bug for several years as the flaw itself is fairly trivial and also eight years old. Now that details of the vulnerability are public, exploit code has been produced, for example, here, and may be handy if you wish to test whether or not your website is vulnerable to CVE-2018-9206. In any case, loads of people now know about it, so that means more miscreants menacing and hijacking vulnerable websites.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: been exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: explained, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: designated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: track, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: noted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: come across, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are known, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are public, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

This is because hackers can exploit two vulnerabilities to gain admin rights or log in using invalid credentials on these servers. Both vulnerabilities were discovered by security researchers from CyberArk, were privately reported to the Jenkins team, and received fixes over the summer. But despite patches for both issues, there are still thousands of Jenkins servers available online. Jenkins is a web application for continuous integration built in Java that allows development teams to run automated tests and commands on code repositories based on test results, and even automate the process of deploying new code to production servers. Jenkins is a popular component in many companies' IT infrastructure and these servers are very popular with both freelancers and enterprises alike. Over the summer, CyberArk researchers discovered a vulnerability (tracked as CVE-2018-1999001) that allows an attacker to provide malformed login credentials that cause Jenkins servers to move their config.xml file from the Jenkins home directory to another location. If an attacker can cause the Jenkins server to crash and restart, or if he waits for the server to restart on its own, the Jenkins server then boots in a default configuration that features no security. In this weakened setup, anyone can register on the Jenkins server and gain administrator access. With an administrator role in hand, an attacker can access private corporate source code, or even make code modifications to plant backdoors in a company's apps. This lone issue would have been quite bad on its own, but CyberArk researchers also discovered a second Jenkins vulnerability --CVE-2018-1999043. This second bug, they said, allowed an attacker to create ephemeral user records in the server's memory, allowing an attacker a short period when they could authenticate using ghost usernames and credentials. Both vulnerabilities were fixed, the first in July and the second in August, but as we've gotten accustomed to in the past few years of covering security flaws, not all server owners have bothered to install these security updates.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: are vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were privately reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: tracked as, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

This month also, the tech giant released a huge patch update to mitigate various flaws in its products. The Microsoft September patch fixed around 61 different vulnerabilities. The patch bundle also included a fix for the recently discovered APLC zero-day vulnerability that has already created trouble. Recently, a zero-day vulnerability disclosed on Twitter has created a lot of chaos as it was immediately exploited in a malware campaign. The APLC zero-day flaw gained attention after a Twitter user with the alias SandboxEscaper disclosed it in a tweet. Later, a CERT/CC researcher verified the bug. This vulnerability in the Windows Task Scheduler allowed an attacker to gain System-level access. As promised at that time by the firm, the Microsoft September patch has addressed this Advanced Local Procedure Call (ALPC) flaw. As disclosed in their advisory, Microsoft acknowledged the exploitation of this vulnerability (CVE-2018-8440). Explaining the details about the bug and the patch released, Microsoft states,     \u201cTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and take control over an affected system. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows handles calls to ALPC.\u201d Besides the single APLC zero-day flaw, Microsoft also patched 61 other flaws in various products, including 17 critical vulnerabilities. The affected software receiving the bug fixes include Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Edge, ChakraCore, Microsoft Office and Web Apps, Microsoft.Data.OData, Internet Explorer, ASP.NET and the .NET Framework. In addition, the Microsoft September patch also addressed a flaw in the Adobe Flash Player (CVE-2018-15967).

The vulnerability impacts all versions of the gaming platform. Tom Court, a security researcher hailing from Context Information Security, discovered the bug and disclosed his findings on Thursday. In a blog post, the researcher said that left unpatched, the bug permits threat actors to perform remote code execution (RCE) attacks. It was not until July last year that Valve added modern ASLR exploit protections to its Steam source code. However, this addition made sure that the vulnerability would only cause a client crash if exploited -- unless a separate information leak vulnerability was also active in the exploit chain.  Valve's Steam software uses a custom protocol, known as the \"Steam Protocol,\" which is delivered on the top of UDP. The protocol registers packet length and the total reassembled datagram length; however, the vulnerability was caused by a simple lack of checks to ensure that for the first packet of a fragmented datagram, the specified length was less than or equal to the total datagram length. All an attacker needed to do was to send a malformed UDP packet to trigger the exploit. \"This means that it is possible to supply a data_len smaller than packet_len and have up to 64kb of data (due to the 2-byte width of the packet_len field) copied to a very small buffer, resulting in an exploitable heap corruption,\" Court says. \"This seems like a simple oversight, given that the check was present for all subsequent packets carrying fragments of the datagram.\" The vulnerability was reported to Valve on 20 February and was fixed in a beta release less than 12 hours later. This patch was then pushed to a stable release on 22 March. \"This was a very simple bug, made relatively straightforward to exploit due to a lack of modern exploit protections,\" Court says. \"The vulnerable code was probably very old, but as it was otherwise in good working order, the developers likely saw no reason to go near it or update their build scripts.\" \"The lesson here is that as a developer it is important to periodically include aging code and build systems in your reviews to ensure they conform to modern security standards, even if the actual functionality of the code has remained unchanged,\" the researcher added.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: impacts, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: left unpatched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was then pushed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

These vulnerabilities would enable remote attacks on all EOS nodes, Qihoo 360 claimed on Weibo Tuesday, May 29. Qihoo 360 writes that they reported the vulnerability to the EOS team and that the EOS mainnet will not launch until the security problems are resolved. Local news outlet Jinse, which noted that EOS asked 360 not to report the vulnerability, claimed that the vulnerabilities have been fixed on the same day, by around 2:00 pm China Standard Time. According to 360\u2019s Weibo post, the vulnerability would allow an attacker to use a smart contract with malicious code to open a security hole, and then use the supernode to enter the malicious smart contract into a new block, thus putting all network nodes under the attacker\u2019s control. Once this action has been completed, the attacker could then control the digital currency on the EOS network, obtain user\u2019s private keys and data, launch a cyber attack, or begin mining for other cryptocurrencies. 360 describes these vulnerabilities as a new \u201cseries of unprecedented security risks\u201d that could affect other blockchain platforms besides EOS:     \u201c360 expressed [hope]  that the discovery and disclosure of this loophole will cause the blockchain industry and security peers to pay more attention to the security of such issues and jointly enhance the security of the blockchain network.\u201d EOS, whose mainnet is scheduled to launch on June 2, is currently down by 2.76 percent over a 24 hour period, trading at around $11.70 by press time, according to Coinmarketcap data.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: claimed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: writes, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are resolved, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: not to report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: post, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: describes, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the discovery and disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

On Tuesday, Adobe said in a security advisory that the update impacts ColdFusion version 11, as well as the 2016 and 2018 releases of the web application development platform. In total, six of the security flaws are deemed critical. The first set of vulnerabilities -- CVE-2018-15965, CVE-2018-15957, CVE-2018-15958, and CVE-2018-15959 -- relate to the deserialization of untrusted data. In addition, CVE-2018-15961 is a security flaw which permits unrestricted file uploads in the software, and the final critical bug, CVE-2018-15960, is described as \"use of a component with a known vulnerability\" which can cause arbitrary file overwrite. If exploited, all of the above security flaws can lead to arbitrary code execution. Three other bugs in ColdFusion have also been resolved. CVE-2018-15962 is a flaw within directory listings that can lead to information disclosure; CVE-2018-15963 is a security bypass bug which could permit attackers to create arbitrary folders, and CVE-2018-15964 is another security flaw caused by the use of a component with a known vulnerability which may cause data leaks. Adobe also released a fix for Adobe Flash Player on desktop Windows, macOS, and Linux machines, as well as Flash for Google Chrome on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Chrome OS, versions 30.0.0.154 and earlier. This security flaw, CVE-2018-15967 is listed as an \"important\" privilege escalation bug which could lead to information disclosure. Originally, Microsoft listed the same vulnerability as critical and one which enabled attackers to perform remote code execution attacks. However, Microsoft has now amended its advisory to reflect Adobe's severity rating. Adobe is not aware of any reports suggesting the vulnerabilities have been exploited in the wild but recommends that users accept the automatic updates as soon as possible.

The privilege escalation vulnerability -- now patched -- is present in current versions of Oracle Solaris 10 and 11 running Sun StorageTek Availability Suite (AVS) for the filesystem and could be used to access to a low-level user or service account and, from there, gain complete root access to the system. The memory corruption bug has been uncovered and detailed by researchers at Trustwave -- and its origins go all the way back to 2007. The original issue was disclosed in 2009 and apparently fixed, but researchers revisited the code this year only to find the fix was partial and loopholes still allowed the execution of malicious code. The origins of the exploit, CVE-2018-2892, lie in one small fragment of code which contains a number of separate vulnerabilities around the dereferencing pointer, the means of getting values stored in a specific memory location. \"Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to take access to a low-level user or service account and gain complete root access to the entire system,\" Neil Kettle, application security principal consultant at SpiderLabs at Trustwave, told ZDNet. An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would need direct access to a user or service account. \"This can be obtained by targeting users with social engineering attacks or by exploiting vulnerabilities in existing services. Once the attacker has access to any account, this vulnerability can be very easily exploited to gain complete root control over the system,\" said Kettle. While the original 2007 vulnerability has probably been used in the wild, there's no confirmation that the new exploit has been used to conduct an attack.

Jenkins uses the Stapler web framework for HTTP request handling, which uses reflection to dispatch incoming web requests to controller code. This means that any public methods that start with get and include string and integer parameters are exposed to the web server. Because this is a common naming convention, this has led to multiple internal Jenkins methods being inadvertently exposed. The precise impact of this isn\u2019t clear. The advisory notes that code execution could be a possible outcome \u2013 though on closer inspection, this seems to be a worst-case scenario. \u201cTo clarify, the vulnerability we addressed had nothing to do with arbitrary code execution, but was rather an issue discovered by the Jenkins security team that allowed a small subset of existing Jenkins code to be invoked by a remote client,\u201d Daniel Beck, Jenkins security officer, told The Daily Swig in an email. \u201cWhile the known impact is pretty limited, we felt that the layer at which the vulnerability existed, and its potential warranted a higher score.\u201d These potential attacks include unauthenticated users being able to invalidate sessions when running with the built-in server, and users with overall/read permissions being able to create new user objects in memory. The advisory reads: \u201cGiven the vast potential attack surface, we fully expect other attacks, that we are not currently aware of, to be possible on Jenkins releases that do not have this fix applied. \u201cThis is reflected in the high score we assigned to this issue, rather than limiting the score to the impact through known issues.\u201d Beck added: \u201cJenkins users should always keep their instances up to date. In this case, we released updates for two LTS lines simultaneously for the first time, so admins could apply the update without having to go through a major version jump. \u201cWe strive to fix all security vulnerabilities in Jenkins and plugins in a timely manner.\u201d Reflection is also used by Apache Struts, via the OGNL library. Struts has suffered a number of serious security flaws in recent years. In 2017, a vulnerability in the framework was exploited to expose the details of up to 148 million Equifax customers.

Microsoft has released a set of new microcode patches from Intel that address Spectre vulnerabilities, as well as the recently disclosed Foreshadow attacks. The updates are available for all supported versions of Windows 10 and Windows Server. As noted on the support page for Windows 10 version 1803, the microcode updates include mitigations for Spectre Variant 3a, CVE-2018-3640, Spectre Variant 4, CVE-2018-3639, as well as two of the Foreshadow bugs, CVE-2018-3615 and CVE-2018-3646, which are also known as L1TF or 'L1 Terminal Fault'. As Microsoft recently highlighted, Windows machines with affected Intel CPUs will need microcode as well as software patches to mitigate the Foreshadow attacks. Microsoft began helping Intel deliver its microcode updates after Intel first started addressing the Meltdown and Spectre CPU flaws in January. The microcode updates help mitigate Spectre Variant 2, CVE-2017-5715.

The security bug received a patch this week, but since the OpenSSH client is embedded in a multitude of software applications and hardware devices, it will take months, if not years, for the fix to trickle down to all affected systems. This particular bug was analyzed last week by security researchers from Qualys who spotted a commit in OpenBSD's OpenSSH source code for a bug report submitted by Darek Tytko from securitum.pl. After analyzing the commit, researchers realized that the code inadvertently fixed a security bug lying dormant in the OpenSSH client since its creation. This bug allows a remote attacker to guess the usernames registered on an OpenSSH server. Since OpenSSH is used with a bunch of technologies ranging from cloud hosting servers to mandate IoT equipment, billions of devices are affected. As researchers explain, the attack scenario relies on an attacker trying to authenticate on an OpenSSH endpoint via a malformed authentication request (for example, via a truncated packet). A vulnerable OpenSSH server would react in two very different ways when this happens. If the username included in the malformed authentication request does not exist, the server responds with authentication failure reply. If the user does exist, the server closes the connection without a reply. This small behavioral detail allows an attacker to guess valid usernames registered on a SSH server. Knowing the exact username may not pose an immediate danger, but it exposes that username to brute-force or dictionary attacks that can also guess its password. Because of OpenSSH's huge install base, the bug is ideal for both attacks on high-value targets, but also in mass-exploitation scenarios. The bug \u2014tracked as CVE-2018-15473\u2014 has been patched in the stable version of OpenSSH \u20141:6.7p1-1 and 1:7.7p1-1\u2014 and the 1:7.7p1-4 unstable branch. Patches have also trickled down to Debian, and most likely other Linux distros.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: trickle down, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was analyzed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: spotted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: a bug report submitted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: tracked as, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: trickled down, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Kubernetes makes it easier to manage a container environment  by organizing application containers into pods, nodes (physical or virtual machines) and clusters. Multiple nodes form a cluster, managed by a master that coordinates cluster-related activities like scaling, scheduling, or updating apps.  Each node has an agent called Kubelet that facilitates communication with the Kubernetes master via the API. The number of nodes available in a Kubernetes system can be hundreds and even thousands. Pulling this off is easy on default configurations, where \"all users (authenticated and unauthenticated) are allowed to perform discovery API calls that allow this escalation,\" says Jordan Liggitt, staff software engineer at Google. The security bug was discovered by Darren Shepherd, co-founder of Rancher Labs company that provides the Kubernetes-as-a-Service solution called Rancher. Now tracked as CVE-2018-1002105, the flaw is critical, with a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score of 9.8 out of 10. According to the latest version of the vulnerability severity calculator, exploiting the security glitch has low difficulty and does not require user interaction. Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform uses Kubernetes for orchestrating and managing containers is also impacted by the vulnerability. In an advisory on the matter, the company explains that the flaw can be used in two ways against its products. One involves a normal user with 'exec,' 'attach,' or 'portforward' rights over a Kubernetes pod (a group of one or more containers that share storage and network resources); they can escalate their privileges to cluster-admin level and execute any process in a container. The second attack method exploits the API extension feature used by \u2018metrics-server\u2019 and \u2018servicecatalog\u2019 in OpenShift Container Platform, OpenShift Online, and Dedicated. No privileges are required and an unauthenticated user can get admin rights to any API extension deployed to the cluster. \"Cluster-admin access to \u2018servicecatalog\u2019 allows creation of service brokers in any namespace and on any node,\" the advisory details.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: tracked as, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: impacted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The number of mobile bank app users is expected to leap 53% in the next four years. So far, mobile banking has been a pretty secure experience. Mobile app breaches represented less than 3% of all computer records hacked last year, according to the Identity Theft Research Center, a San Diego tracking firm. But don\u2019t get cozy. A veritable flood of consumers is heading for mobile, according to Juniper Research. It predicts over 3 billion people around the world will be banking on mobile by 2021 \u2014 quite a lure for hackers who target financial apps. That means more people are likely to fall prey, so bank customers will need to be ready to protect their devices and their bank accounts. Criminals try to access mobile apps in a number of ways.  When a mobile app communicates with a financial institution\u2019s server over the internet, the app verifies the bank\u2019s or credit union\u2019s identity by checking its server certificate. With a man-in-the-middle attack, fraudsters will try to \u201clisten in\u201d on this network traffic, perhaps by accessing the same public Wi-Fi network as the mobile user, and attempt to send a fake bank server certificate to the mobile app. If the app accepts the fake certificate, it could let the hacker receive the user\u2019s personal information.  When installed on a mobile device, key logger programs secretly record a person\u2019s actions as he or she uses the device. With a banking app, the malicious software could log your account names, numbers and passwords and send them to a hacker.  It\u2019s been around for years, but this tried and true hack is still popular with criminals, says Doug Johnson, senior vice president of payments and cybersecurity policy at the American Bankers Association. It occurs when a fraudster pretends to be a legitimate financial institution that asks a mobile user to submit private bank information. Many phishing attempts bypass mobile apps completely. A hacker could send emails telling people their account is locked and asking them to reply to the message with their account username and password. But the account isn\u2019t locked, and the information a person sends would go to the criminal, not the bank.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: send, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: pretends to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attempts, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: could send, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

The ads open users up to phishing attacks that attempt to scam people into giving private information such as bank details to online fraudsters. Google says the ads create an 'abusive experience for users', including fee messages, unexpected clicks, phishing attempts and misleading site behaviour.  The firm tried to stop manipulative adverts in an update last February but now admits that it 'did not go far enough'.  Chrome currently has an option to enable a pop-up blocker but fraudsters have quickly found ways around this. The company declined to name the companies involved in the crackdown but said that the update will block ads from a 'small number of sites with persistent abusive problems'.  Pop-ups are small windows that tend to show system warnings which are difficult to close, as well as 'watch video' buttons. When the company announced its previous crackdown back in February, critics were quick to point out that the firm wanted to make ads more tolerable - so that their own could get past filters. Some said that the aim was to persuade people to disable their ad block so as not to deprive publishers (including Google) from displaying their advertisements and thus depriving them of revenue.  Although they did not go into detail about why the previous block didn't work, Chrome product manager Vivek Sekhar said: 'We've learned since then that this approach did not go far enough.'  'In fact, more than half of these abusive experiences are not blocked by our current set of protections, and nearly all involve harmful or misleading ads.' Advertisements also tend to be a hotbed for malicious software or scams where fraudsters trick people into giving out their personal information. Once a pop-up is clicked on, the ad can take you to a separate web page asking you to download an application and actually triggers an onslaught of more pop-up ads[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has announced, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: failed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attempts, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: tried to stop, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: will block, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Scamsters contact you via fake emails, phone calls, recorded message, SMS, etc, and either scare you with the possibility of some legal action or entice you with a tax refund! Every tax season, Tax Scams start doing the rounds. Emails, Phone calls, or recorded messages by cybercriminals impersonating authentic tax agents have become an order of the day and continue to remain a major threat to taxpayers. The scam artists use sinister designs that threaten police arrest, deportation, and even license revocation. With the increases in its popularity, fraudsters are also busy finding more ways to increase efficiency. Earlier, the major targets were elderly people and immigrant population. Slowly, the focus has shifted to methods that rely on auto-dialers, robocalling, and voice mail messages to hit as many taxpayers as possible. The story begins with an automated call. It plays a recorded message warning you that it\u2019s \u201cthe final notice\u201d from the tax agency such as the Internal Revenue Service, Indian Income Tax Department, HM Revenue and Customs, or the Tax department of your country. Or it could begin with an email. In any case, the recorded voice or email purports to be from tax inspector and goes on to specify about the course of action, the agency is likely to follow against you like, planning a lawsuit against you, and if you don\u2019t return this call, you could land up in jail, soon. Attacks, such as these use fear as bait or the lure of a tax refund on the other hand. They rely on social engineering tactics. One such message tells recipients that there\u2019s a pending law enforcement action against them as they have evaded tax. It is mainly used to target U.S. taxpayers. The scam pretends to contain information about a subpoena. It could contain a web link which it wants you to click. The link could take you to a fraudulent website.

Fraudsters are targeting taxpayers with spurious emails and text messages pretending to be from the government.  I received one such email over the weekend, telling me I was due a refund of \u00a3222.32.  The email came complete with a bogus 'HMRC Transaction Confirmation' number and a link claiming to be to the Government Gateway, which is used to access online government services. Of course, I would just need to click on the bogus link with my 'credit/debit card ready' so the criminals at the other end of the link could scam my cards for as much money as possible. At first glance, it may look fairly convincing - the spelling and grammar is pretty good, it contains plenty of official-looking reference numbers and the web links are at least in part quite similar to the genuine articles.  But it's very definitely a 'phishing' email - whereby the fraudster sender is trying to hook you into providing personal information. In this case, they're after my credit or debit card numbers. Phishing happens by text message too. Earlier this month HMRC reported people are nine times more likely to fall for text message scams than other types such as email because they can appear more legitimate, with many texts displaying \u2018HMRC\u2019 as the sender, rather than a phone number. It also said it had 'stopped thousands of taxpayers from receiving scam text messages, with 90 per cent of the most convincing texts now halted before they reach their phones'. To help you protect yourself and your bank account, there are several warning signs you should always look out for to determine whether such emails and texts are fakes   This is in case they contain malware - software with a virus that can read personal information on your computer \u2013 or destroy it.

According to police, swindlers pretended to be friends of WhatsApp users and invented different excuses to lure them into revealing their account verification codes.

Mohammed said genuine account holders were unable to use WhatsApp at least 12 hours after their accounts were hijacked. \u201cAll the scam victims were asked to buy MyCard points cards for online games,\u201d he said.  MyCard is a digital payment platform. Users can buy credit to spend on the platform from convenience stores across the city, Mohammed said.

It was from one of the local construction firms the public institution deals with, logo and all. There was new bank account information \u2014could accounts payable please change it? The staff and this supposed vendor communicated back and forth, from late June until a few weeks ago, in early August. One university employee was involved in this correspondence at first; two more were added. Then vendor payments went through, as scheduled: $1.9 million from MacEwan accounts on August 10. Another $22,000 were transferred seven days later. Finally, $9.9 million went to this new bank account on August 19, a Saturday. Wednesday morning, for the first time in this episode, came a phone call. The Edmonton-area vendor wanted to know why it never got its payments. The massive fraud had already been perpetrated, $11.8 million winding its way into a TD bank account in Montreal and much of it then wired overseas, a university spokesman says. Investigators have traced $11.4 million of the money and frozen the suspect accounts in Quebec and Hong Kong. The school is pursuing civil legal action to recover the money. \u201cThe status of the balance of the funds is unknown at the time,\u201d a MacEwan statement said about the other $400,000.

What hit MacEwan was a spear phishing attack, in which scammers impersonate a client or associate of the individual. In this case, the fraudster had cut-and-pasted the actual vendor\u2019s logo, MacEwan spokesman David Beharry said. A phishing attacker will often cast several lures; in this case, investigators said 14 different Edmonton-area construction sites or firms were impersonated as part of this attempt.

The presence of vulnerable code is enough to expose the system to attack\u2014the web application doesn\u2019t need to implement file upload for attackers to exploit the flaw, said researchers from Cisco Talos. Talos \u201cfound a high number of exploitation events,\u201d said Cisco threat researcher Nick Biasini. \u201cWith exploitation actively underway, Talos recommends immediate upgrading if possible or following the workaround referenced in the above security advisory\u201d. The remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638) in the Jakarta Multipart parser is the result of improper handling of the Content-Type header, Apache said in its emergency security advisory. The header indicates the media type of the resource, such as when the client tells the server what type of data was sent as part of a POST or PUT request, or the server telling the client what type of content is being returned as part of the response. The flaw is triggered when Struts parses a malformed Content-Type HTTP header and lets attackers remotely take complete control of the system without needing any kind of authentication.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: need to update, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploit, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Billions of \u201cphishing\u201d emails purporting to be from companies we trust such as Apple and Amazon, or banks, charities and even government departments, are reaching consumers\u2019 inboxes. Their intention is to trick recipients into visiting a website \u2013 specially created to mirror a legitimate business\u2019s site \u2013 and entering personal details such as email addresses and passwords. These can be used by criminals in a number of ways, including accessing bank accounts, making payments or applying for credit or other services. Phishing emails are cleverly designed to mimic the firm\u2019s real emails. They are increasingly well-written. Worryingly, as fraudsters invest more in their processes, the emails are also more likely to bypass spam filters. To add to the convincing effect, criminals are buying domain names similar to the companies they are impersonating, so recipients are more likely to think the emails real. Since January Action Fraud, the national cybercrime reporting service, has issued alerts about scams involving fake correspondence from HMRC, Amazon, and the Department of Education, among others. But now the proliferation of these emails is causing some to question whether the real businesses are doing enough to protect their customers. Chris Underhill, chief technical officer at Cyber Security Partners, a consultancy, said firms that communicate by email have a \u201ccorporate responsibility\u201d to prevent fraudsters impersonating them online. He said many firms were failing to take the basic \u2013 and inexpensive \u2013 precaution of buying up domain names similar to their own. He said: \u201cThe technology is there for little cost but sadly the adoption rate is low. \u201cThe responsibility is now placed on the consumer to check the sender of the emails is real.\u201d Telegraph Money found it was possible, for example, to buy domain names such as amazonuk.org, amazon.eu.co.uk or amazonuk.tech for as little as \u00a35.99 per year. Andrew Goodwill, of The Goodwill Group, a fraud-prevention consultancy, said consumers should \u201cbe incredibly sceptical\u201d about any unsolicited digital communication even from familiar companies.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: purporting to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: created to mirror, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: mimic, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: are impersonating, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Scammers have been using Hurricane Harvey-themed messages to trick people into opening phishing emails and links on social media sites, which can steal login information, infect machines with malware, or con victims out of money. US-CERT, a cybersecurity arm of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, issued a warning about the threat on Monday. \u201c[R]emain vigilant for malicious cyber activity seeking to capitalize on interest in Hurricane Harvey,\u201d the advisory read. \u201cEmails requesting donations from duplicitous charitable organizations commonly appear after major natural disasters.\u201d As the advisory notes, a common scam during and after natural disasters is for fraudsters to pretend to set up relief funds and request donations. Fortune has seen several suspicious online profiles and personas that, although their legitimacy couldn\u2019t be determined, raised several red flags: a small number of followers, unverified accounts, no apparent links to accredited charities, and no means to track where proceeds go. Zack Allen, threat operations manager at ZeroFOX, a social media-focused cybersecurity startup, says the ruse is a typical one. \u201cCybercriminals are opportunists and, sadly, a crisis like Hurricane Harvey is a prime example of their preying on humanity\u2019s empathy and trust,\u201d he wrote in an email to Fortune. \u201cPeople all over the world quickly rushed to their social media accounts to find the best avenues to donate to victims, but these same avenues are ideal for scammers who try to convince victims to donate to their fraudulent Hurricane Harvey cause.\u201d Kevin Epstein, vice president of threat operations at Proofpoint (pfpt, +1.21%), a cybersecurity firm that provides email protection, said that in recent days he has seen hurricane-related snares such as \u201csee this terrifying video\u201d or pleas to \u201cdonate to the relief effort.\u201d One PDF attachment titled \u201churricane harvey \u2013 nueces county news release 11 \u2013 it\u2019s your chance to help.pdf\u201d prompted people, when opened, to enter their email username and password, he told Fortune.

Well, WannaCry certainly added a new dimension to the ransomware danger, because it combined the data-scrambling process with self-spreading computer virus code. As a result, WannaCry could worm its way through your network automatically, potentially leaving you with hundreds or even thousands of scrambled computers in a single attack, even if only one user opened a booby-trapped attachment or downloaded a file from a poisoned website. The crooks behind the SamSam ransomware have also latched onto a rather different approach: instead of trying to reach thousands or tens of thousands of victims around the world with a hard-hitting spam campaign, and squeezing each of them for hundreds or thousands of dollars each, the SamSammers seem to attack one organisation at a time. Indeed, the SamSammers generally keep their hand hidden until they have broken into the network and figured out, using similar techniques to penetration testers, a list of computers they know they can encrypt all at the same time. Then they let fly on all of those identified devices at once, giving them a much higher chance of scrambling at least some computers that are critical to the workflow of your company, Finally, they make a payment demand, typically charging a few thousand dollars for each individual computer you want to unlock, but also offering an all-you-can-eat deal of $50,000 to decrypt everything. The bad news is that this WannaCrypt \u201cdemanding money with menaces\u201d threat email is very widespread \u2013 we\u2019ve had people worried about it from all over, which is why we decided to write up this warning.

Colorado officials said they never caved to the attacker\u2019s demands to pay bitcoin in order to recover encrypted computer files. But clearing each computer took time and additional resources \u2014 including the Colorado National Guard \u2014 to investigate, contain and recover. \u201cWe were able to recover from the SamSam attack relatively quickly due to our robust backup plan and our segmentation strategies,\u201d Brandi Simmons, a spokesperson for Colorado\u2019s Office of Information Technology, said in an email. \u201cWe are still capturing costs associated with the incident, but our estimate is between $1M and $1.5M.\u201d What started with a core team of 25 IT employees, Simmons said, ballooned to 150  \u201cduring the peak of the incident\u201d \u2014 March 2-9. She added that others included CDOT, the FBI, state emergency operations and private companies. The million-dollar estimate includes only overtime pay and other unexpected costs. The state\u2019s new backup system prevented data loss, but personal data on employees\u2019 computers may not be recovered. The cyberattack started around Feb 21 when a variant of the SamSam ransomware hijacked CDOT computer files. CDOT shut down more than 2,000 computers. Its employees had to use personal devices to check email. The state did not share the value of bitcoin that attackers demanded. Elsewhere, SamSam attacked the city of Atlanta, debilitating computer systems that residents used to pay traffic tickets, report potholes and access Wi-Fi at the airport. The city hasn\u2019t issued a public update since March 30, and a city spokesman said Thursday there is nothing new to share. Attackers demanded $51,000 worth of bitcoin.

A check of newspapers across Ohio reveals similar unfortunate targets around the state: Licking County government, the Columbiana County courts and townships in Clinton and Morrow counties were once all ransomware victims. In Clark County, hackers encrypted the Mad River Twp. Fire and EMS servers with ransomware in December. The damage extends across the nation: When a library system in South Carolina faced a ransomware attack, patrons couldn\u2019t check out or return books. In Richmond, Indiana, the local housing agency fell victim to a $8,000 ransom. Hackers shut down 2,000 computers at Colorado\u2019s transportation department, then attacked again when the agency tried to recover. While the hackers\u2019 ideal target \u2014 and the damage caused \u2014 varies, one certainty is that local governments are not exempt from the pain of ransomware, which is malicious software that threatens to block access to data or to publish it unless the infected organization pays a ransom. The ransom demands are often relatively small compared to an organization\u2019s overall budget, but the cost of avoiding payment can be steep, as the city of Atlanta found this year. An attacker demanded a $50,000 ransom to restore the Atlanta\u2019s systems, but the city ended up shelling out nearly $2.7 million on eight emergency contracts in an attempt to fix the problem.

According to a news release from Allied Physicians of Michiana CEO Shery Roussarie, the company became aware of the cyberattack on Thursday afternoon and immediately took steps to shut down the network in order to protect personal and protected health information of patients. The company restored its data in a secure format without significant disruption to patients, but an investigation is ongoing to confirm that personal or protected health information wasn\u2019t compromised. The type of ransomware, known as SamSam, has been used in other attacks to coerce businesses, municipalities and individuals to pay a ransom in order to unlock files held hostage by the infection. In March, the city of Atlanta was attacked by SamSam ransomware that crippled its court system, prevented water bill payments and forced city employees to file paper reports. \u201cThe security of our patients\u2019 personal and protected health information is foremost in our mind\u201d Roussarie said in the news release. \u201cWhile we make every effort to keep ahead of these types of cyberattacks, we have nevertheless taken additional steps to minimize any such future attack of the type experienced last week.\u201d Allied Physicians would not say whether or not it has paid a ransom, or what amount was demanded by the SamSam hackers, but that it plans to work with \u201call relevant regulatory agencies, including the FBI, to thoroughly define the scope of the incident.\u201d[/INST]\n\nTrigger: compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: pay a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was attacked, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: has paid a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Soon after Atlanta City Auditor Amanda Noble logged onto her work computer the morning of March 22, she knew something was wrong. The icons on her desktop looked different\u2014in some cases replaced with black rectangles\u2014and she noticed many of the files on her desktop had been renamed with \u201cweapologize\u201d or \u201cimsorry\u201d extensions. Noble called the city\u2019s chief information security officer to report the problem and left a message. Next, she called the help desk and was put on hold for a while. \u201cAt that point, I realized that I wasn\u2019t the only one in the office with computer problems,\u201d Noble says. Those computer problems were part of a high-profile \u201cransomware\u201d cyberattack on the City of Atlanta that has lasted nearly two weeks and has yet to be fully resolved. During that time the metropolis has struggled to recover encrypted data on employees\u2019 computers and restore services on the municipal Web site. The criminals initially gave the city seven days to pay about $51,000 in the cryptocurrency bitcoin to get the decryption key for their data. That deadline came and went last week, yet several services remain offline, suggesting the city likely did not pay the ransom. City officials would not comment on the matter when contacted by Scientific American. The Department of Watershed Management, for example, still cannot accept online or telephone payments for water and sewage bills, nor can the Department of Finance issue business licenses through its Web page. The Atlanta Municipal Court has been unable to process ticket payments either online or in person due to the outage and has had to reschedule some of its hearings. The city took down two of its online services voluntarily as a security precaution: the Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport wi-fi network and the ability to process service requests via the city\u2019s 311 Web site portal, according to Anne Torres, Atlanta\u2019s director of communications.

Earlier this year attackers used a derivative of SamSam to lock up files at Hancock Regional Hospital in Greenfield, Ind.

The attackers set up an online payment portal for the city but soon took the site offline after a local television station published a screen shot of the ransom note, which included a link to the bitcoin wallet meant to collect the ransom. Several clues indicate Atlanta likely did not pay the attackers, Williams says. \u201cRansomware gangs typically cut off communications once their victims get law enforcement involved,\u201d he says. \u201cAtlanta made it clear at a press conference soon after the malware was detected\u201d that they had done so. The length of time it has taken to slowly bring services back online also suggests the cyber criminals abandoned Atlanta without decrypting the city\u2019s files, Williams says. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, the city\u2019s IT staff spent the past week rebuilding Atlanta\u2019s online systems using backed-up data that had not been hit by the ransomware,\u201d he says, adding that any data not backed up is likely \u201clost for good.\u201d \u201cIf the city had paid the ransom, I would have expected them to bring up systems more quickly than they have done,\u201d says Justin Cappos, a professor of computer science and engineering at New York University\u2019s Tandon School of Engineering. \u201cAssuming the city did not pay the ransom, their ability to recover their systems at all shows that they at least did a good job backing up their data.\u201d[/INST]\n\nTrigger: find, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: demand payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay a larger ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: set up, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: been hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: had paid the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The national ID numbers for at least 14,000 Argentinians have been exposed, but the leak could potentially affect tens of thousands more people. The website held thousands of credit-related dispute records, faxes and national identity numbers for Argentinians who had filed complaints. It also stored the usernames and passwords in plaintext for about 100 of the company's customer service representatives. The findings were first reported by cybersecurity blogger Brian Krebs, who notified Equifax. The website has now been shut down. The findings will put further pressure on Equifax, which has been criticized for its haphazard and slow response to a breach that exposed the personal details of 143 million U.S. consumers, as well as an as-yet-unspecified number of British and Canadian residents. Alex Holden, founder and CTO of Hold Security, tells Information Security Media Group that the Equifax website for Argentina \"could be exploited by a 3-year-old.\" He says he didn't use any advanced hacking techniques to uncover the breach. Holden - a veteran investigator credited with discovering the massive Adobe Systems and Target data breaches in 2013 - says he still found the Equifax findings \"completely unexpected and surprising.\" Equifax says it acted immediately to halt the leak, which is unrelated to the breach it announced Sept 7, says Meredith Griffanti, the company's spokeswoman for Latin America. The data was a \"limited amount of public information strictly related to consumers who contacted our customer service center and the employees who managed those interactions,\" she says. \"We have no evidence at this time that any consumers, customers, or information in our commercial and credit databases were negatively affected, and we will continue to test and improve all security measures in the region,\" Griffanti says.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have been exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the leak, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: a breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Proofpoint researcher Kafeine has identified six compromised Chrome extensions that have been recently modified by an attacker after phishing a developer's Google Account credentials.  Web Developer 0.4.9, Chrometana 1.1.3, Infinity New Tab 3.12.3, Copyfish 2.8.5, Web Paint 1.2.1, and Social Fixer 20.1.1 were compromised in late July and early August. Kafeine believes TouchVPN and Betternet VPN were also comprised in late June with the same technique. Developers of several of the extensions have removed the threat in recent updates to their affected apps, including Web Developer, Copyfish, Chrometana, and Social Fixer. The main intent of the attack on Chrome extension developers is to divert Chrome users to affiliate programs and switch out legitimate ads with malicious ones, ultimately to generate money for the attacker through referrals.  The attackers have also been gathering credentials of users of Cloudflare, an availability service for website operators, which probably could be used in future attacks. The hijacked extensions were coded mostly to substitute banner ads on adult websites, but also a range of other sites, and to steal traffic from legitimate ad networks.  \"In many cases, victims were presented with fake JavaScript alerts prompting them to repair their PC, then redirecting them to affiliate programs from which the threat actors could profit,\" notes Kafeine. At least one of the affiliate programs receiving the hijacked traffic promoted PCKeeper, a Windows-focused tool originally from ZeobitLLC, the maker of the MacKeeper security product that was the subject of a class action suit a few years ago over false security claims. A snippet of JavaScript in the compromised extensions also downloaded a file that was served by Cloudflare containing code with a script designed to collect Cloudflare user credentials after login. Cloudflare stopped serving the file after it was alerted to the issue by Proofpoint. The phishing emails that compromised developers' Google Accounts purported to come from Google's Chrome Web Store team, which claimed the developer's extension didn't comply with its policies and would be removed unless the issue was fixed.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have been phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: have removed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have also been gathering, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were presented, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: purported to come from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: was fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The vulnerability, which has been assigned CVE\u20132018\u201317456 by Mitre, has been fixed in Git 2.19.1. To trigger the vulnerability, a malicious repository could forge a .gitmodules containing an URL starting with a dash. This would affect both git clone --recurse-submodules and git submodule update --recursive in that they would recursively pass the URL starting with a dash to a git clone or git submodule subprocess that would interpret the URL as a command option. This could lead to executing an arbitrary command on the local machine. This vulnerability is similar to CVE\u20132017\u20131000117, which also enabled an option-injection attack by forging ssh URLs starting with a dash that would be interpreted as an option by the ssh subprocess executed by git. No exploits are known at the moment.     We were also able to use the time to scan all repositories on GitHub for evidence of the attack being used in the wild. As shown in the PR fixing the vulnerability, submitted by @joernchen, the fix is quite trivial in itself. Yet, this discovery provided the opportunity for an overall audit of .gitmodules, which led to implementing stricter checks on both paths and URLs found inside of it. As mentioned, the fix for this vulnerability is included in Git 2.19.1. Additionally, it has been backported to versions 2.14.5, 2.15.3, 2.16.5, 2.17.2, and 2.18.1.

Microsoft has patched a major zero-day vulnerability in Windows, the second such exploit detected in just a few weeks. The threat, the second such alert in just a month, was spotted by security experts at Kaspersky Lab and fixed as part of Microsoft's monthly Patch Tuesday release. Kaspersky Lab says the exploit had already been utilised for a number of cyberattacks in the Middle East, and was detected by the company's Automatic Exploit Prevention technology. The vulnerability, officially named by Microsoft as CVE-2018-8589, targeted the 32-bit version of Windows 7, and could have allowed attackers to gain \"elevated privileges\" and create exploits to gain access to a victim's system and run malicious code. The news comes just a few weeks after Kaspersky Lab detected a similar zero-day threat in Microsoft's system, having alerted the computing giant to a further Windows vulnerability that had been utilised by state-backed cyber-espionage group known as FruityArmor. \u201cAutumn 2018 became quite a hot season when it comes to zero-day vulnerabilities,\" said Anton Ivanov, Security Expert at Kaspersky Lab.  \"In just a month, we discovered two of their kind and detected two series of attacks in one region.

By zero-day, it means that a vulnerability has been exposed but it is not yet patched. Darren Allan in TechRadar was one of the tech watchers reporting on the vulnerability, which could occur through a privilege escalation bug. \"The user linked to a page on GitHub which appears to contain a proof-of-concept (PoC) for the vulnerability,\" said Charlie Osborne in ZDNet. \"CERT/CC (the US cybersecurity organization which looks to counter emerging threats) has confirmed that this vulnerability can be leveraged against a 64-bit Windows 10 PC which has been fully patched up to date, \" said TechRadar, in turn referring to a story in The Register, Richard Chergwin, The Register, had reported that \"CERT/CC vulnerability analyst Will Dormann quickly verified the bug.\" CERT/CC did a formal investigation, and posted an advisory. \"'Microsoft Windows task scheduler contains a vulnerability in the handling of ALPC, which can allow a local user to gain SYSTEM privileges,' the alert stated.\" This can be leveraged to gain SYSTEM privileges. We have confirmed that the public exploit code works on 64-bit Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 systems. We have also confirmed compatibility with 32-bit Windows 10 with minor modifications to the public exploit code. Compatibility with other Windows versions is possible with further modifications.\" Should we worry? Allan said it is a local bug. The attacker would have to be already logged into the PC to exploit it, or be running code on the machine. But wait. Though local, Ars Technica's Peter Bright let its readers know what the flaw allows one to do. Not pretty. Bright wrote that \"The flaw allows anyone with the ability to run code on a system to elevate their privileges to 'SYSTEM' level, the level used by most parts of the operating system and the nearest thing that Windows has to an all-powerful superuser.\" Osborne in ZDNet said that while the impact was limited, \"the public disclosure of a zero-day is still likely a headache for the Redmond giant.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has been exposed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is not yet patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: reporting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has confirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been fully patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: had reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: verified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: contains, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: confirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: confirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Apple has secretly patched a bunch of high-severity bugs reported to it by Google's Project Zero researchers. The move has resulted in Google's Project Zero once again calling Apple out for fixing iOS and macOS security flaws without documenting them in public security advisories. While it's good news that Apple beat Project Zero's 90-day deadline for patching or disclosing the bugs it finds, the group's Ivan Fratric recently argued that the practice endangered users by not fully informing them why an update should be installed. This time the criticism comes from Project Zero's Ian Beer, who's been credited by Apple with finding dozens of serious security flaws in iOS and macOS over the years. Beer posted a blog about several vulnerabilities in iOS 7 he found in 2014 that share commonalities with several bugs he has found in iOS 11.4.1, some of which he's now released exploits for. Beer notes that none of the latest issues is mentioned in the iOS 12 security bulletin even though Apple did fix them. The absence of information about them is a \"disincentive\" for iOS users to patch, Beer argues.  \"Apple are still yet to assign CVEs for these issues or publicly acknowledge that they were fixed in iOS 12,\" wrote Beer. \"In my opinion a security bulletin should mention the security bugs that were fixed. Not doing so provides a disincentive for people to update their devices since it appears that there were fewer security fixes than there really were.\" In other instances, such as one macOS bug Beer reported, Apple did actually assign a CVE, but it still hasn't updated the relevant security bulletin to reflect the fix. Apple similarly allocated CVE-2018-4337 to another high-severity iOS bug, which was fixed in iOS 12, but isn't currently acknowledged in the iOS 12 security bulletin. In another case, Apple fixed a bug that affected iOS and macOS but didn't assign a CVE or mention it in the security bulletins. Not only may it be a disincentive for end-users to patch iPhones and Macs, but Beer also points out in another bug report that the lack of public acknowledgement by Apple means he has no way of knowing whether the issue is a duplicate that another researcher may have already found.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has secretly patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: finds, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: finding, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: posted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: notes, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: did fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: assign CVEs, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: update, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: assign a CVE, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: hasn't updated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: allocated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: acknowledged, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: didn't assign, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: points out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: public acknowledgement, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: may have already found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

According to IBM, the vulnerability would potentially allow an attacker to remotely execute Java code on a vulnerable web-app server via its SOAP connector port. The bug was sealed up on September 5, when IBM made the fix available for download and installation. Unfortunately, the patch had been causing problems, forcing IBM to pull the fix on Wednesday, more than a month. Big Blue said the patch was yanked \"due to regression\", which is the fancy way of saying it was mucking stuff up. \"There may be a failure after the security fix for PI95973 is installed,\" IBM tells customers. \"The fix has been removed while it is being reworked by development.\" IBM did not say when the updated patch might be arriving, putting some admins in the difficult position of either leaving a vulnerability open or risking crashes.

The EFAIL-specific fixes address two errors in Thunderbird's handling of encrypted messages: CVE-2018-12372, in which an attacker can build S/MIME and PGP decryption oracles in HTML messages; and CVE-2018-12373, in which S/MIME plaintext can be leaked if a message is forwarded. EFAIL was announced with a much-criticised process. The discoverers emphasised the issue's exploitability to read messages encrypted with PGP and S/MIME \u2013 but the vulnerabilities were specific to client implementations. Thunderbird users will therefore welcome news that the client has joined the list of EFAIL-safe email tools. Thunderbird 52.9 also includes some critical-rated fixes. CVE-2018-12359 was a buffer overflow leading to a potentially exploitable crash: \u201cA buffer overflow can occur when rendering canvas content while adjusting the height and width of the <canvas> element dynamically, causing data to be written outside of the currently computed boundaries.\u201d The other, CVE-2018-12360, is a use-after-free, also with a potentially exploitable crash: \u201cA use-after-free vulnerability can occur when deleting an input element during a mutation event handler triggered by focusing that element.\u201d Security researcher Matt Nelson noticed that under Windows 10, users weren't getting warned when they were opening executable SettingContent-ms files (CVE-2018-12368).

Appliances running Cisco's DNA Center software before Release 1.1.4 are vulnerable to an authentication bypass that could allow a remote attacker to \"take complete control\" of its identity management functions. Network admins can use the DNA Center interface to add new devices to the network and manage them based on enterprise policies. DNA Center is part of Cisco's toolkit for internet-based networking. Lax security restrictions on key DNA management functions mean an attacker could send a valid identity management request to an affected system and then change existing system users or create new users, according to Cisco. The flaw, which is tracked as CVE-2018-0448, is rated critical and has a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v 3.0 rating of 9.8 out of 10.  It's fixed in release 1.1.4 and later and since there are no workarounds, admins will need to update to these releases to fix the bug. Cisco also fixed another critical DNA Center flaw, CVE-2018-15386, which could give a remote attacker direct access to core management functions. An attacker could exploit the bug by directly connecting to exposed DNA Center services and from there obtain or change critical system files. This bug is due to insecure default configurations affecting DNA Center release 1.1 Again, there are no workarounds for the bug, so admins will need to update to release 1.2 and later. Both flaws were found during internal testing. Cisco is not aware of any exploits in the wild for the flaws. Cisco has also fixed a critical flaw affecting Cisco Prime Infrastructure (PI) that could let a remote attacker upload any file they wishwithout requiring authentication. The file could be used to execute commands. On PI, Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is enabled by default and accessible from the web interface, which an attacker could use toupload a malicious file. Customers should check Cisco's advisory to determine whether they're running a fixed release. It also has workarounds for some releases. The flaw was reported by independent security researcher Pedro Ribeiro through Beyond Security's SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure program.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has plugged, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is tracked as, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: update, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: obtain, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: update, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has also fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The company says that it learned about the vulnerability through a report from Google. CVE-2018-8653 affects a range of versions of Internet Explorer from 9 to 11, across Windows 7 to 10 and Windows Server. The vulnerability amounts to a remote code execution exploit, and it was first spotted by Google's Threat Analysis Group. Microsoft explains that a problem with Internet Explorer's scripting engine could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's computer. In a short security advisory, the company says: Today, we released a security update for Internet Explorer after receiving a report from Google about a new vulnerability being used in targeted attacks. Customers who have Windows Update enabled and have applied the latest security updates, are protected automatically. We encourage customers to turn on automatic updates. Microsoft would like to thank Google for their assistance. In a more detailed security vulnerability posting, Microsoft explains the impact of the problem: A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website, for example, by sending an email. The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was first spotted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: explains, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: receiving a report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have applied, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: exists in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is designed, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: convince, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: addresses, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: modifying, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The open vulnerability was reportedly identified over a year ago by an independent researcher but USPS never patched it until this week, when Krebs on Security flagged the issue. The vulnerability included all 60 million user accounts on the website. It was caused by an authentication weakness in the site\u2019s application programming interface (API) that allowed anyone to access a USPS database offered to businesses and advertisers to track user data and packages. The API should have verified whether an account had permissions to read user data but USPS didn\u2019t have such controls in place. Users\u2019 personal data including emails, phone numbers, mailing campaign data were all exposed to anyone who was logged into the site. Additionally, any user could request account changes for another user, so they could potentially change another account\u2019s email address and phone number, although USPS does at least send a confirmation email to confirm the changes. Since street addresses are searchable through the database, any logged-in user could see who was living at each residence and even gain the data of multiple people in the same household. Krebs notes that because of the vulnerability, \u201cno special hacking tools were needed to pull this data.\u201d USPS said in a statement to Krebs: \u201cAny information suggesting criminals have tried to exploit potential vulnerabilities in our network is taken very seriously. Out of an abundance of caution, the Postal Service is further investigating to ensure that anyone who may have sought to access our systems inappropriately is pursued to the fullest extent of the law.\u201d A recent audit of its system in October did not turn up this vulnerability, although it did find numerous other weaknesses. We\u2019ve reached out for comment on whether USPS was aware of the issue when it was initially noted over a year ago. So far, no known exploits were made through this vulnerability.

Switchzilla has issued a new fix to address CVE-2018-15442, a command injection bug in its video conference software that allows a local attacker to their elevate privileges, and then execute code by injecting commands through the software update component of the WebEx Meetings Client. The bug was traced back to the failure by Webex Meetings to properly check arguments passed via its update service commands. Thus a miscreant could run an update command with specially crafted arguments to ultimately execute code with system privileges. This means rogue logged-in users or malware on a Windows system could leverage WebEx to completely hijack the machine. Cisco had hoped to plug the vulnerability in October with a patch that was thought to have resolved the flaw. However, software-breakers at SecureAuth found that Switchzilla failed to account for DLL preloading. By sticking the malicious commands inside a DLL file and then executing the update program with that library loaded, an attacker would be able to circumvent the patch and then exploit the flaw as before to execute commands with system-level clearance. \"The vulnerability can be exploited by copying to an a local attacker controller folder, the ptUpdate.exe binary. Also, a malicious dll must be placed in the same folder, named wbxtrace.dll,\" SecureAuth explained in its disclosure today. \"To gain privileges, the attacker must start the service with the command line:\" Fortunately, the flaw was privately disclosed to Cisco, giving the teleconferencing vendor time to get out a fix prior to this bug going public. Those running Webex Meetings on their Windows machines should update as soon as possible. While the flaw isn't as severe as a remote code bug that could be exploited without any user interaction, the fact it has now been patched twice and has working proof-of-concept code public should make patching a priority.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: addressing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: plug, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have resolved, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploit, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was privately disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: get out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has now been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Following the disclosure, shares of Facebook extended midday losses and ended trading 2.5 percent down. \"This is a very serious security issue, and we're taking it very seriously,\" said CEO Mark Zuckerberg on a call with reporters. Facebook shares, which were already down about 1.5 percent before the announcement, extended losses after the disclosure and ended down 2.6 percent. The company said in a blog post that its engineering team found on Tuesday that attackers identified a weakness in Facebook's code regarding its \"View As\" feature. Facebook became aware of a potential attack after it noticed a spike in user activity on September 16. \"View As\" lets users see what their profile looks like to other users on the platform. This vulnerability, which consisted of three separate bugs, also allowed the hackers to get access tokens \u2014 digital keys which let people stay logged into the service without having to re-enter their password \u2014 which could be used to control other people's accounts. Almost 50 million accounts had their access tokens taken, and Facebook has reset those tokens. The company also reset tokens for an additional 40 million accounts who used the \"View As\" feature in the last year as a precautionary measure, for a total of 90 million accounts. Facebook had 2.23 billion monthly active users as of June 30. The reset will require these users to re-enter their password when they return to Facebook or access an app that uses Facebook Login. They will also receive a notification at the top of their News Feed explaining what happened. In addition, the company suspended the \"View As\" feature while it reviews its security. Facebook said it fixed the issue on Thursday night and has notified law enforcement including the FBI and the Irish Data Protection Commission in order to any address General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) issues. Facebook said it has just begun its investigation and has not determined if any information was misused, but the initial investigation has not uncovered any information abuse. The hackers did query Facebook's API system, which lets applications communicate with the platform, to get more user information. The company is not sure if the hackers used that data, nor does it know who orchestrated the hack or where the person or people are based.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: announced, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Google Project Zero whizkid and Tamagotchi whisperer Natalie Silvanovich discovered and reported the flaw, a memory heap overflow issue, directly to WhatsApp in August. Now that a fix is out, Silvanovich can go public with details on the potentially serious flaw. According to Silvanovich\u2019s report, the bug is triggered when a user receives a malformed RTP packet, triggering the corruption error and crashing the application. In practice, the malformed packet that triggers the crash could be sent via a simple call request. \u201cThis issue can occur when a WhatsApp user accepts a call from a malicious peer,\u201d Silvanovich explained. It\u2019s not clear whether the WhatsApp security flaw could be exploited for remote code execution, but this is a possibility, and a sufficient risk for a fellow Google researcher to describe it as \u2018a big deal.\u2019 \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d tweeted Travis Ormandy. \u201cJust answering a call from an attacker could completely compromise WhatsApp.\u201d The same vulnerability was present in the Android app, which has also been patched. The Register says it is still waiting to hear from Google on more details, for example whether the desktop app is similarly affected. It\u2019s not the first time of late that a WhatsApp security issue has been identified. Back in August, it was discovered that it was possible for an attacker to change both the content and the sender of a WhatsApp message after you\u2019ve received it.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: reports, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered and reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: go public, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: Silvanovich\u2019s report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: describe, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was present in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has also been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: is similarly affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been identified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Google is stoking those disagreements again this week by disclosing a Microsoft Edge security flaw before a patch is available. Neowin spotted that Google disclosed the security flaw to Microsoft back in November, and the company provided 90 days for Microsoft to fix it before going public as it\u2019s rated \u201cmedium\u201d in terms of severity. Google also provided Microsoft with an additional 14-day grace period to have a fix available for its monthly Patch Tuesday release in February, but Microsoft missed this goal because \u201cthe fix is more complex than initially anticipated.\u201d It\u2019s not clear when Microsoft will have a fix available, and the Google engineer responsible for reporting the security flaw says because of the complexity of the fix Microsoft \u201cdo not yet have a fixed date set as of yet.\u201d The public disclosure will likely anger Microsoft, once again. The software giant hit back at Google\u2019s approach to security patches last October, after discovering a Chrome flaw and \u201cresponsibly\u201d disclosed it to Google so the company had enough time to patch. At the heart of the issue is whether Google\u2019s policy to disclose after 90 days without a patch is reasonable. Google makes exceptions to this hard rule, with grace periods, and can even disclose much sooner if the vulnerability is being actively exploited. Google disclosed a major Windows bug back in 2016 just 10 days after reporting it to Microsoft, and the company has revealed zero-day bugs in Windows in the past before patches are available. Two big and obvious exceptions to Google\u2019s security disclosure rules were the recent Meltdown and Spectre bugs. Google engineers discovered the CPU flaws and Intel, AMD, and others had around six months to fix the problems before the flaws were publicly disclosed earlier this year. Chrome OS and Android devices were also affected by the processor flaws, along with Windows, Linux, macOS, and iOS. Google wants the industry to adopt its aggressive disclosure policies, but Microsoft has so far resisted rather publicly.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: security vulnerability disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: going public, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: missed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: reporting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: approach, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovering, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: \u201cresponsibly\u201d disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclose, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reporting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were publicly disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were also affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Cisco this week said it patched a \u201ccritical\u201d patch for its Prime License Manager (PLM) software that would let attackers execute random SQL queries. The Cisco Prime License Manager offers enterprise-wide management of user-based licensing, including license fulfillment. Released in November, the first version of the Prime License Manager patch caused its own \u201cfunctional\u201d problems that Cisco was then forced to fix. That patch, called ciscocm.CSCvk30822_v1.0.k3.cop.sgn addressed the SQL vulnerability but caused backup, upgrade and restore problems, and should no longer be used Cisco said. Cisco wrote that \u201ccustomers who have previously installed the ciscocm.CSCvk30822_v1.0.k3.cop.sgn patch should upgrade to the ciscocm.CSCvk30822_v2.0.k3.cop.sgn patch to remediate the functional issues. Installing the v2.0 patch will first rollback the v1.0 patch and then install the v2.0 patch.\u201d As for the vulnerability that started this process, Cisco says it \u201cis due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied input in SQL queries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP POST requests that contain malicious SQL statements to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify and delete arbitrary data in the PLM database or gain shell access with the privileges of the postgres [SQL] user.\u201d The vulnerability impacts Cisco Prime License Manager Releases 11.0.1 and later.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: Released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: installed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: upgrade, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: Installing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: install, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: impacts, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Researcher Artem Moskowsky told The Register earlier this week that he stumbled across the vulnerability \u2013 which earned him a $20,000 bug bounty for reporting it \u2013 by accident while looking over the Steam partner portal. That's the site developers use to manage the games they make available for download from Steam. A professional bug-hunter and pentester, Moskowsky said he has been doing security research since he was in school, and for the past several years, he has made a career out of finding and reporting flaws. In this case, while looking through the Steam developer site, he noticed it was fairly easy to change parameters in an API request, and get activation keys for a selected game in return. Those keys, also known as CD keys, can be used to activate and play games downloaded from Steam. The API is provided so developers and their partners can obtain license keys for their titles to pass onto gamers. \"This bug was discovered randomly during the exploration of the functionality of a web application,\" Moskowsky explained. \"It could have been used by any attacker who had access to the portal.\" Essentially, anyone who had an account on the developer portal would be able to access the game activation keys for any other game Steam hosted, and sell or distribute them for pirates to use to play games from Steam. Fetching from the /partnercdkeys/assignkeys/ API with a zero key count returned a huge bunch of activation keys. \"To exploit the vulnerability, it was necessary to make only one request,\" Moskowsky told El Reg. \"I managed to bypass the verification of ownership of the game by changing only one parameter. After that, I could enter any ID into another parameter and get any set of keys.\" How severe was the flaw? Moskowski says that, in one case, he entered a random string into the request, to pick a title at random, and in return he got 36,000 activation keys for Portal 2, a game that still retails for $9.99 in the Steam store. Fortunately for Valve, Moskowsky opted to privately come forward with the flaw via HackerOne. The programming blunder has since been fixed.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: been exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: stumbled, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reporting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: finding and reporting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: explained, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has since been fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The information that could have been viewed by unauthorized parties includes email addresses, hashed and salted passwords, locations, previously used email addresses, and last login IPs. The flaw resided in the \u201cRecommended Blogs\u201d feature in the desktop version of Tumblr. The widget shows logged-in users a list of blogs that may be of interest to them. \u201cIf a blog appeared in the module, it was possible, using debugging software in a certain way, to view certain account information associated with the blog,\u201d said Tumblr. Discovered and reported through the platform\u2019s bug bounty program several weeks ago, the security vulnerability was resolved within 12 hours. The New York-based company also said that it couldn\u2019t determine which specific accounts were at risk, although its analysis is said to have shown that \u201cthe bug was rarely present\u201d. The site, which has over 440 million blogs, gave assurances to its users that it has found no evidence to suggest that any data was actually lifted. At the same time, the platform said that users needn\u2019t take any action. In these cases, \u201ctaking action\u201d usually means \u201cChange your passwords!\u201d Nevertheless, the company\u2019s decision to disclose the flaw is because of what Tumblr says is its commitment to transparency and because it believes that \u201cit\u2019s simply the right thing to do\u201d. It has also taken steps to \u201cimprove monitoring and analysis procedures to help it identify and fix any similar bugs in the future\u201d. Tumblr has joined the ranks of other high-profile technology companies, such as Twitter, Facebook and Google, that have all revealed vulnerabilities in recent weeks that could have been exploited, or were actually exploited, for harvesting the private information of some users. Back in 2016, Tumblr had its hands full with a security incident that compromised the details of 65 million Tumblr users as a result of a breach dating back to 2013.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been viewed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: resided in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: Discovered and reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was resolved, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclose, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: identify, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have all revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: been exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: harvesting, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: a breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The vulnerability in question, (CVE-2018-8423), is a memory corruption vulnerability that exists in the Jet Database Engine that, when exploited, allows for remote code execution. 0patch noticed that the patch Microsoft had issued was flawed as a result of studying the official patch of the Jet Database Engine and a \u201cmicropatch\u201d that the security researchers had created for the same flaw. They explain this revelation as follows: As expected, the update brought a modified msrd3x40.dll binary: this is the binary with the vulnerability, which we had micropatched with 4 CPU instructions (one of which was just for reporting purposes). The version of msrd3x40.dll changed from 4.0.9801.0 to 4.0.9801.5 and of course, its cryptographic hash also changed - which resulted in our micropatch for this issue no longer getting applied to msrd3x40.dll. So far so good, but the problems became glaring once further analysis began:     We BinDiff-ed the patched msrd3x40.dll to its vulnerable version and reviewed the differences. At this point we will only state that we found the official fix to be slightly different to our micropatch, and unfortunately in a way that only limited the vulnerability instead of eliminating it. We promptly notified Microsoft about it and will not reveal further details or proof-of-concept until they issue a correct fix. It may be a little frustrating to not know what the problem is from a tech journalist\u2019s perspective, but as I am also an \u201cethical\u201d hacker, I totally understand the lack of disclosure on the part of both Microsoft and 0patch. If the flaw is not public knowledge and has not been patched, it makes no sense to hand a cybercriminal the keys to Windows user\u2019s machines. What this story shows is how vital the relationship between third-party security researchers and vendors. Without the due diligence of first Trend Micro\u2019s ZDI discovering the original flaw, and then 0patch uncovering the secondary flaw in the patch, Microsoft and their customers would be exposed to hackers with bad intentions.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: in question, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exists in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: had issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: issue, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has not been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovering, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: uncovering, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Google Project Zero whizkid and Tamagotchi whisperer Natalie Silvanovich discovered and reported the flaw, a memory heap overflow issue, directly to WhatsApp in August. Now that a fix is out, Silvanovich can go public with details on the potentially serious flaw. According to Silvanovich's report, the bug is triggered when a user receives a malformed RTP packet, triggering the corruption error and crashing the application. In practice, the malformed packet that triggers the crash could be sent via a simple call request. \"This issue can occur when a WhatsApp user accepts a call from a malicious peer,\" Silvanovich explained. \"It affects both the Android and iPhone clients.\" While Silvanovich has not said whether further actions (like remote code execution) would be possible to pull off in the wild, the flaw was serious enough to draw the attention of fellow Google researcher Tavis Ormandy. Fortunately, as the bug has been patched users will be able to get a fix for the flaw by updating to the latest version of WhatsApp on Android and iOS. We're still waiting to hear from Google or Facebook on more details, such as if the desktop app is affected of if RCE is possible, but its PR team has a lot on today.

These vulnerabilities also include a critical security bug that allegedly affected Mozilla\u2019s Firefox and Firefox ESR browsers as well. Last week, Mozilla patched multiple security flaws altogether in its latest Thunderbird 60.3 including a critical security flaw. As explained in Mozilla\u2019s security advisory, numerous community members and developers at Mozilla discovered reported memory safety bugs that only affected Thunderbird email client, but also had impacted Firefox and Firefox ESR. Describing the bugs (CVE-2018-12390), Mozilla stated, Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. Mozilla has fixed the bugs in Firefox 63, Firefox ESR 60.3, and Thunderbird 60.3 respectively. Apart from the critical memory safety bugs, Mozilla also released fixes for several other vulnerabilities affecting Thunderbird. These include three vulnerabilities with a high severity level, and low severity level memory safety bugs (CVE-2018-12389). The three high severity flaws include:     CVE-2018-12391: HTTP Live Stream audio data accessible cross-origin (affected Firefox for Android only). The bug could allow accessing audio data across origins during HTTP live stream playback on the Firefox browser for Android.     CVE-2018-12392: Crash with nested event loops. An attacker could trigger an exploitable crash by exploiting the bug.     CVE-2018-12393: Integer overflow during Unicode conversion while loading JavaScript. This out-of-bounds write vulnerability only affected 32-bit builds. With regards to the conditions for the exploit, Mozilla elaborated, In general, these flaws cannot be exploited through email in the Thunderbird product because scripting is disabled when reading mail, but are potentially risks in browser or browser-like contexts. Mozilla patched multiple vulnerabilities in the previous versions of Thunderbird and Firefox last month. That time too, Mozilla released a fix for critical code execution vulnerability affecting Thunderbird 60.2, Firefox 61 and Firefox ESR 60.1.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has recently fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: had impacted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The original security flaw, CVE-2018-15442, is present in the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows and is described as a bug which \"could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user.\" Cisco's original security update was published in October in order to remedy the flaw, in which a lack of validation for user-supplied parameters in the app could be harnessed to exploit the bug. If an attacker is successful in utilizing the vulnerability, they can force the app to run arbitrary commands with user privileges. \"While the CVSS Attack Vector metric denotes the requirement for an attacker to have local access, administrators should be aware that in Active Directory deployments, the vulnerability could be exploited remotely by leveraging the operating system remote management tools,\" the company added. Software releases prior to 33.6.4 -- alongside Cisco Webex Productivity Tools Releases 32.6.0 and later prior to 33.0.6 -- are impacted on Windows systems. It was not long after the release of the first patch that researchers from SecureAuth deemed the original fix incomplete. The original patch only forced the service to run files signed by Webex, but failed to account for DLL-based attacks, according to the team. \"The vulnerability can be exploited by copying to a local attacker controller folder, the ptUpdate.exe binary,\" the researchers said in an advisory. \"Also, a malicious dll must be placed in the same folder, named wbxtrace.dll. To gain privileges, the attacker must start the service with the command line: sc start webexservice install software-update 1 \"attacker-controlled-path\" (if the parameter 1 doesn't work, then 2 should be used).\" These findings were sent to Cisco, which acknowledged the DLL attack method. A new patch was then issued roughly a week after being informed of the issue. \"After an additional attack method was reported to Cisco, the previous fix for this vulnerability was determined to be insufficient,\" Cisco says. \"A new fix was developed, and the advisory was updated on November 27, 2018, to reflect which software releases include the complete fix.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: is present in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is described, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: remedy, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the release, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being informed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was developed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was updated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: releases, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

One of them, a privileged access bug found in seven models of its Small Business Switches, has not yet been patched, but the company has recommended a workaround to limit its potential for damage. Designated CVE-2018-15439 with a CVSS score of 9.8, the unsolved privileged access vulnerability could allow a remote attacker to bypass an affected device\u2019s user authentication mechanism and obtain full admin rights without the proper administrators being notified. Although there is currently no software fix, a Cisco advisory says users can implement a workaround by \u201cadding at least one user account with access privilege set to level 15 in the device configuration.\u201d Affected device models are the Cisco Small Business 200 Series Smart Switches, Small Business 300 Series Managed Switches, Small Business 500 Series Stackable Managed Switches, 250 Series Smart Switches, 350 Series Managed Switches, 350X Series Stackable Managed Switches and 550X Series Stackable Managed Switches. The other critical flaws confirmed in Cisco products were an authentication bypass vulnerability in the Stealthwatch Management Console of Cisco Stealthwatch Enterprise and a remote shell command execution bug in Unity Express. These also carry CVSS scores of 9.8.

This happened during Apple's update for critical flaws in iOS 12, tvOS 12 and Safari 12 on September 17. A Wayback Machine snapshot of the original advisory doesn't mention any of the bugs that Project Zero researcher Ivan Fratric had reported to Apple, and which were actually fixed. Then, a week later, after Apple patched the same bugs in macOS, the company updated its original advisory with details about the nine flaws that Fratric had reported, six of which affected Safari. The update fixed a Safari bug that allowed arbitrary code execution on macOS if a vulnerable version of Safari browsed to a website hosting an exploit for the bugs. While Fratric concedes that Apple is probably concealing the fix in iOS to buy time to patch macOS, he argues the end result is that people may ignore an important security update because they weren't properly informed by Apple in the security advisory. \"This practice is misleading because customers interested in the Apple security advisories would most likely read them only once, when they are first released and the impression they would get is that the product updates fix far fewer vulnerabilities and less severe vulnerabilities than is actually the case.\" Even worse, a skilled attacker could use the update for iOS to reverse-engineer a patch, develop an exploit for macOS, and then deploy it against a macOS user-base that doesn't have a patch. Users also don't know that Apple has released information that could make their systems vulnerable to attack. Fratric developed an exploit for one of the Safari bugs he reported and published the attack on Thursday. The bugs were all found using a publicly available fuzzing tool he developed, called Domato, meaning anyone else, including highly advanced attackers, could use it too. \"If a public tool was able to find that many bugs, it is expected that private ones might be even more successful,\" he noted. He wasn't aiming to write a reliable or sophisticated exploit, but the bug is useful enough for a skilled exploit writer to develop an attack to spread malware and \"potentially do a lot of damage even with an unreliable exploit\".[/INST]\n\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixes, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: update, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: mention, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: had reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: updated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: had reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: is probably concealing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported and published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were all found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The problem affects versions of Internet Explorer from 9 to 11 across multiple versions of Windows, but it seems that the patch has been causing problems for many people. Specifically, people with some Lenovo laptops have found that after installing the KB4467691 patch they are unable to start Windows.  When the patch was released, it was known that there were a few issues with older versions of Windows 10 -- for example, problems with the .NET framework, and with web links in the Start menu. But since the initial release, Microsoft has updated the patch page to indicate a further potential problem with some Lenovo laptops:     After installing KB4467691, Windows may fail to startup on certain Lenovo laptops that have less than 8 GB of RAM. The company goes on to suggest a couple of possible workarounds for those running into issues:     Restart the affected machine using the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). Disable Secure Boot and then restart.     If BitLocker is enabled on your machine, you may have to go through BitLocker recovery after Secure Boot has been disabled.

The software giant said it learned about the weakness (CVE-2018-8653) after receiving a report from Google about a new vulnerability being used in targeted attacks. Satnam Narang, senior research engineer at Tenable, said the vulnerability affects the following installations of IE: Internet Explorer 11 from Windows 7 to Windows 10 as well as Windows Server 2012, 2016 and 2019; IE 9 on Windows Server 2008; and IE 10 on Windows Server 2012. \u201cAs the flaw is being actively exploited in the wild, users are urged to update their systems as soon as possible to reduce the risk of compromise,\u201d Narang said. According to a somewhat sparse advisory about the patch, malware or attackers could use the flaw to break into Windows computers simply by getting a user to visit a hacked or booby-trapped Web site. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.

The US Postal Service has fixed a security bug in its website that allowed anyone with an account to see the account details of the site's 60 million users. The flaw was patched this week after USPS was informed of the issue by Krebs on Security, which reports that an unnamed independent researcher reported the bug a year ago but never received a response. According to Krebs, the flaw was caused by an authentication weakness in the application programming interface (API) on usps.com that supported the USPS 'Informed Visibility' program, which offers business customers \"near real-time tracking data\" about mail campaigns and packages.  The bug let anyone who was logged in to usps.com to see account details for others users, including email address, username, user ID, account number, street address, phone number, authorized users, mailing campaign data and more. Krebs notes that the \"API also let any user request account changes for any other user, such as email address, phone number or other key details\". USPS said in a statement it had no information that the vulnerability had been used to access customer records. \"Computer networks are constantly under attack from criminals who try to exploit vulnerabilities to illegally obtain information. Similar to other companies, the Postal Service's Information Security program and the Inspection Service uses industry best practices to constantly monitor our network for suspicious activity,\" USPS said. \"Any information suggesting criminals have tried to exploit potential vulnerabilities in our network is taken very seriously. Out of an abundance of caution, the Postal Service is further investigating to ensure that anyone who may have sought to access our systems inappropriately is pursued to the fullest extent of the law.\"  However, a recent vulnerability assessment of the Informed Visibility program by the Office of Inspector General of the US Postal Service turned up weaknesses, including a lack of audit logs, in the Informed Visibility database.

One thing that probably isn't on their minds is whether they're going to get hacked. But that's all Carnegie Mellon University's IT department thinks about. Back-to-school season means hordes of vulnerable computers arriving on campus. The beginning of the semester is the most vulnerable time for a campus network, and every year, with new students coming in, schools have to make sure everything runs smoothly. Carnegie Mellon's network gets hit with 1,000 attacks a minute -- and that's on a normal day. Cybersecurity is an increasingly important aspect of our everyday lives, with technology playing a massive role in nearly everything we do. Universities have been vulnerable to attacks in the past, with cybercriminals stealing student and faculty databases and hackers vandalizing university websites.   Students are often targets for hackers, even before they're officially enrolled. Considering how much money flows into a university from tuition costs, along with paying for room and board, criminals are looking to cash in on weak campus cybersecurity. A bonus for hackers: Admissions offices often hold data with private information like student Social Security numbers and addresses, as well as their families' data from financial aid applications.  Phishing happens when hackers steal your passwords by sending you links to fake websites that look like the real deal. It's how Russians hacked the Democratic National Committee during the presidential election, and it's a popular attack to use on universities as well. The latest warning, sent Monday, called out malware hidden in a document pretending to be from Syracuse University's chancellor. Digging through my old emails, I found about 20 phishing warnings that had gone out during the four years I'd been there. Syracuse declined to comment on phishing attacks against the school, but in a 2016 blog post, it said the attacks were \"getting more frequent, cunning and malicious.\"  The school is not alone. Duo Security, which protects more than 400 campuses, found that 70 percent of universities in the UK have fallen victim to phishing attacks.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: attacks, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stealing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: Phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: look like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: pretending to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

But it just rolled out the feature last year. Kendra Cooley, a security analyst at Duo Security, pointed out that students are more likely to fall for phishing attacks because they haven't been exposed to them as frequently as working adults have. Also, cybercriminals know how to target young minds. \"You see a lot of click-bait phishing messages like celebrity gossip or free travel,\" Cooley said. All students at Carnegie Mellon are required to take a tech literacy course, in which cybersecurity is a focus, said Mary Ann Blair, the school's chief information security officer. The school also runs monthly phishing campaigns: If a student or faculty member falls for the friendly trap, they're redirected to a training opportunity. When your network is being hit with at least two phishing attempts a day, Blair said, it's a crucial precaution to keep students on guard. \"It's just constantly jiggling the doorknobs to see if they're unlocked,\" Blair said. \"A lot of it is automated attacks.\"   It's not just the thousands of new students that have university IT departments bracing for impact, it's also their gadgets. \"All these kids are coming on campus, and you don't know the security level of their devices, and you can't manage it, because it's theirs,\" said Dennis Borin, a senior solutions architect at security company EfficientIP. A lot of university IT teams have their hands tied because they can't individually go to every student and scan all their computers. Borin's company protects up to 75 campuses across the United States, and it's always crunch time at the beginning of the semester. \"If I was on campus, I wouldn't let anybody touch my device,\" Borin said. \"So if somebody has malware on their device, how do you protect against an issue like that?\" Instead of going through every single student, Borin said, his company just casts a wide net over the web traffic.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing campaigns, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: falls, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trap, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attempts, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

All of the school's web services were down for an entire week while recovering from the attack, Borin said.  Scam artists love to take advantage of timing, and the back-to-school season is a great opportunity for them. There was an influx of fake ransomware protection apps when WannaCry hit, as well as a spike in phony Pokemon Go apps stuffed with malware during the height of the game's popularity. If there's a massive event going on, you can bet people are flooding the market with phony apps to trick victims into downloading viruses. A quick search for \"back to school apps\" in August found 1,182 apps that were blacklisted for containing malware or spyware, according to security firm RiskIQ.    Researchers from the company scanned 120 mobile app stores, including the Google Play store, which had more than 300 blacklisted apps. They found apps for back-to-school tools; themes and wallpapers for your device; and some apps that promised to help you \"cheat on your exams.\" Though most of the blacklisted apps are poorly made games, others pretend to help you be a better student. Other warning signs to watch out for when it comes to sketchy apps are poorly written reviews and developers using public domain emails for contacts, Risk IQ said. For any educational apps, like Blackboard Learn, you should always check the sources and look for the official versions.   New students coming to school have enough to worry about. Let's hope a crash course in cybersecurity is enough to ensure they make it to graduation without getting hit by hacks.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: WannaCry hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

An analysis of over one thousand phishing kits designed to allow wannabe cybercriminals to build phishing emails and websites found that, in a significant proportion of cases, the trainee phishers are being compromised, with their stolen data being secretly sent to the kit authors. With phishing simple to carry out but potentially very financially rewarding -- some of the highest profile cyber-attacks of recent years began with a phishing email -- it's no wonder that newbie hackers want in. But their lack of skill is coming back to bite some of these aspiring cybercriminals, who might find that all their ill-gotten gains are also transferred to the original author of the kit. Researchers at Imperva analysed 1,019 readily-available phishing kits, finding underground markets filled with low-cost and free phishing kits advertised as means of providing aspiring cyber-attackers with a route into the illegal industry.  \"Underground markets are full of phishing kits at all levels and cost, some even distributed at no charge, usually revealing one of the oldest rules in the book -- you get what you pay for,\" said Luda Lazar, security research engineer at Imperva. \"Here we found the only free cheese is in the mousetrap,\" she added. While these phishing kits did provide aspiring attackers with the files necessary to create a copy of target websites and steal valuable information, many of these free offerings contain an undisclosed backdoor.  That means the kit author is able to secretly track the campaigns of the crooks using the software and gain access to the stolen information themselves. In doing so, they're able exploit the likes of stolen usernames, passwords, and credit card details without putting in the effort required to collect them. As a result, the phishing kit user can't reap much from their criminal gains, as in many cases, victims will change passwords or cancel credit cards if they realise they've been targeted.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: being phished, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: build, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: are being compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: create, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: track, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: gain access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: collect, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The operation has been temporarily disrupted this month when Ukrainian cyber police shut down servers hosting some of the phishing sites, acting on information they received from Cisco's Talos security division. No arrests were made, and it's very likely that the group will make a comeback in the future.  The group \u2014which Cisco tracked internally under the codename of Coinhoarder\u2014 has been operating for years, but appears to have used the same scheme since February 2017, possibly earlier. Crooks purchase so-called typosquatted domains that imitate the real Blockchain.info Bitcoin wallet management service. Coinhoarder operators then set up phishing pages on these domains that log users credentials, which they later use to steal funds from users' accounts. According to Cisco, instead of using malvertising or spam campaigns, crooks buy legitimate ads via the Google AdWords platform and place links to their phishing sites at the top of Bitcoin-related Google search results. This trick is not only simple to execute but very effective. Cisco reported that based on DNS query data, ads for one domain roped in over 200,000 users. It is believed the group lured tens of millions of users to its phishing sites. It is unclear how many users tried to log in on the fake sites, but after tracking down various thefts reported on social media and involving some of the Coinhoarder groups typosquatted domains, Cisco says the group made around $50 million worth of Bitcoin in the past three years. For example, in one campaign that took place from September 2017 to December 2017, the group made around $10 million, while in another campaign that lasted 3.5 weeks, the group made another $2 million.  Researchers also point out that crooks used geo-targeting filters for their ads, targeting mostly Bitcoin owners in Africa. \"This threat actor appears to be standing up phishing pages to target potential victims African countries and other developing nations where banking can be more difficult, and local currencies much more unstable compared to the digital asset,\" researchers said in a report published yesterday. \"Additionally, attackers have taken notice that targeting users in countries whose first language is not English make for potentially easier targets.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: imitate, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: set up, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: place links, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lured, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: appears to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Users of BT\u2019s popular email service should be aware of a new scam which is targeting customers across the UK. The latest threat, which was unleashed over the weekend, suggests that customers\u2019 bills are overdue and need to be paid as soon as possible. The full message reads, \u201cYour latest bill is now overdue. You can view it online at My BT or on the app. To log in, you'll need your BT ID.

Criminals pose as the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency in a bid to extort motorists of their cash by requesting this bank details. These crooks usually try to achieve this by threatening a monetary punishment of some sort or in other cases by stating that the driver is entitled to a refund. The problem for some motorists could fall for the fraudulent messages especially as they often look fairly professional and can even contain the logo of the DVLA Motorists Jason Price, however, was not fooled by the latest attempt by fraudsters trying to get him to hand over his details.

Scammers approach people via email to encourage them to hand over private or sensitive information about themselves or the company they work for. \u201cThe most prevalent threats we see targeting consumers today are phishing attacks predominantly via email, where scammers try to trick people into sharing private information or access to money,\u201d Jessica Brookes, director of EMEA consumer at McAfee, told the Press Association. \u201cThe first thing you should know about phishing is that it almost always involves a form of \u2018social engineering\u2019, in which the scammer tries to manipulate you into trusting them for fraudulent purposes, often by pretending to be a legitimate person or business. Secondly, if an email doesn\u2019t seem legitimate, it probably isn\u2019t; it\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry.\u201d Here are four of the most popular scams circulating today: 1) The CEO Scam  This scam appears as an email from a leader in your organisation, asking for highly sensitive information like company accounts or employee salaries. The hackers fake the boss\u2019s email address so it looks like a legitimate internal company email. That\u2019s what makes this scam so convincing \u2013 the lure is that you want to do your job and please your boss. But keep this scam in mind if you receive an email asking for confidential or highly sensitive information, and ask the apparent sender directly whether the request is real, before responding. 2) The Lucky Email How fortunate! You\u2019ve won a free gift, an exclusive service, or a great deal on a trip abroad. Just remember, whatever \u201climited time offer\u201d you\u2019re being sold, it\u2019s probably a phishing scam designed to get you to give up your credit card number or identity information. The lure here is something free or exciting at what appears to be little or no cost to you. 3) The Urgent Email Attachment Phishing emails that try to trick you into downloading a dangerous attachment that can potentially infect your computer and steal your private information have been around for a long time.

The most common way for cybercriminals to steal bank account information, passwords, credit cards or social security numbers is to simply ask for them. Every day, people fall victim to phishing scams that cost them their time and their money. Those emails urgently warning users to update their online financial accounts\u2014they\u2019re fake. That email directing users to download a document from a cloud-storage provider? Fake. Those other emails suggesting the recipients have a $64 tax refund waiting at the IRS or that the IRS needs information about insurance policies\u2014also fake. So are many new and evolving variations of these schemes. The Internal Revenue Service, state tax agencies and the tax community are marking National Tax Security Awareness Week with a series of reminders to taxpayers and tax professionals. Phishing attacks use email or malicious websites to solicit personal, tax or financial information by posing as a trustworthy organization. Often, recipients are fooled into believing the phishing communication is from someone they trust. A scam artist may take advantage of knowledge gained from online research and earlier attempts to masquerade as a legitimate source, including presenting the look and feel of authentic communications, such as using an official logo. These targeted messages can trick even the most cautious person into taking action that may compromise sensitive data. The scams may contain emails with hyperlinks that take users to a fake site. Other versions contain PDF attachments that may download malware or viruses. Some phishing emails will appear to come from a business colleague, friend or relative. These emails might be an email account compromise. Criminals may have compromised your friend\u2019s email account and begin using their email contacts to send phishing emails. Not all phishing attempts are emails, some are phone scams.

By creating these lookalike sites with domain names that are almost identical to the URLs we know and trust, it\u2019s made telling the difference between fake and genuine sites \u2013 and avoiding phishing scams \u2013 increasingly difficult. Research by security company Wandera revealed that people are three times more likely to fall for a phishing scam if it is on their phone.  As a result, this new scam targets smartphone users, where the lookalike sites are harder to spot.  A recent survey that tested the British public\u2019s knowledge of scams and online security behaviours found 16% of British adults have experienced online fraud. For phishing scams specifically, it\u2019s one in ten of us. The most common age group to experience online fraud is 35 \u2013 54, with almost one-fifth (19%) of this demographic having fallen victim to a scam. CEO of Get Safe Online, Tony Neate, said: \u201cWhile online fraud is common, it becomes less so when you engage common sense. \u201cIt is very easy to clone a real website and does not take a skilled developer long to produce a very professional-looking but malicious site, but if you know what to look for, it\u2019s easy to stay safe.\u201d   There are numerous ways to determine whether or not a received email is from a legitimate company trying to help, or a scammer looking to steal financial details. The initial sender is a good starting point. Take the time to look at the email address you\u2019re being contacted by, not just the name. An unfamiliar address, or one that doesn\u2019t correspond with the company, is a giveaway that it\u2019s a fraudster. Then take a look at the greeting. If the email opens with \u2018Dear loyal customer\u2019 or \u2018Hello (followed by your email address)\u2019 then it\u2019s another telltale sign. The real company would address you by your full name and make it personal to you. Careless slip-ups in the copy of the email are also giveaways. Does any of the grammar or spelling not sit quite right? This is a big indicator that it\u2019s a phishing scam.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: creating, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing scams, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: a phishing scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: this new scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing scams, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: clone, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: a phishing scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Stay Safe Online issued a high alert for the latest scam on Wednesday. \"It's tax time and the common scam email informing that you're eligible for a tax refund is doing the rounds again,\" the warning said. \"Scammers have long used the promise of a tax refund to trick people into sharing their personal information or to download malware.\" The phishing email claims to come from myGov and has the subject line, \"Important information regarding your account\", as well as the myGov logo. It asks you to click on a link to claim your refund. The link leads to a fake tax refund claim form, asking for personal details such as email, password, and credit card details. \"After you supply this information and click the continue button, you'll be automatically redirected to the myGov website. By then it's too late and the scammer has your details.\" Stay Safe Online said scammers can use that information to commit credit card fraud and identity theft. \"The ATO and myGov will never send an email or SMS asking you to click on a link and provide login, personal or financial information, download a file or open an attachment.\" Earlier this month scammers used a cloned version of myGov website in an attempt to lure in victims with a phishing email.

These new robocalls are a lot like the ones you\u2019ve already gotten on your phone at all hours of the day and night: Your phone rings, you pick up, and after a brief pause or maybe a quiet click or beep, a prerecorded voice message meets your ears. The recording, which often sounds like a young woman, usually delivers a message about lowering credit-card rates or buying into cheap health insurance. If you fall for the bait, you\u2019re transferred to a live human who will try anything to get you to hand over your credit-card or bank account info. The important thing to remember is that sales robocalls are illegal in the United States. So, don\u2019t expect the person on the other end of the line to follow through on whatever deal they claim to offer. You\u2019re much more likely to fall victim to an identity theft scam or credit-card fraud than to score a deal from one of these spam callers. The new Chinese-language version of these calls targets immigrants. The robocalls deliver a recorded message claiming to be from the Chinese consulate, saying the recipient is in trouble with Chinese officials, or sometimes that a package is waiting at the Chinese consulate that needs to be picked up. Then, the robocall asks for a deposit or fee, demanding a credit-card number or bank information. Sometimes the robocall or live operator who follows it makes a threat, suggesting that more trouble will come if the person doesn\u2019t willingly hand over their financial info, according to the Federal Trade Commission. In New York City alone, police estimate at least 30 residents had been scammed out of $3 million, according to National Public Radio.  The Chinese Consulate General in New York says it has posted dozens of alerts on its website warning about the scams. \"We would like to restate that the Consulate General in New York would not ask for personal information, deliver parcel pick-up notice or ask people to answer inquiries from police department by way of phone calls. The Consulate General would not ask for bank account information,\" it warned.

Attacks with this ransomware strain were first spotted last Monday, August 13, according to independent security researcher MalwareHunter, who first tweeted about this new threat.  There have been several reports from victims regarding infections with Ryuk in the past week, including one on the Bleeping Computer forums. But despite these reports, security researchers from various companies have not been successful at identifying how this ransomware spreads and infects victims. The common train of thought is that this ransomware spreads via targeted attacks, with the Ryuk crew targeting selected companies one at a time, either via spear-phishing emails or Internet-exposed and poorly secured RDP connections, albeit researchers have not been able to pinpoint the exact entry vector for infections as of yet. \"According to what we can see right now, it seems the attacks are targeted, i.e. a result of some manual compromise,\" Mark Lechtik, a Check Point security researcher, told Bleeping Computer in a private conversation today.  \"Reason for this is that the malware needs Admin privileges to run, which it doesn't achieve on its own. Something else that executes it had to achieve this privilege,\" he added. \"But no artifact was found to show what spawned the execution of the malware (i.e. no mail, document, script etc.).\" Ryuk shuts down over 180 services on infected hosts But there are also some differences. The main one, spotted by both Check Point and MalwareHunter is that Ryuk comes with a huge list  of apps and services it shuts down before infecting a victim's systems. \"The ransomware will kill more than 40 processes and stop more than 180 services by executing taskkill and net stop on a list of predefined service and process names,\" Check Point researchers explained in a report. The ransom note conundrum Furthermore, Ryuk's targeted nature is never more obvious than when it comes to its ransom notes. Check Point says it found several Ryuk samples where the ransomware dropped different ransom notes on users' systems. Researchers found a long, more verbose ransom note, and another, blunter and to-the-point ransom demand.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: dropped, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Coincidentally or not, the ransom fees demanded via the longer and more detailed ransom note were higher (50 Bitcoin ~ $320,000), compared to the shorter ransom note, where crooks asked for a smaller amount of money (15-35 Bitcoin, ~$224,000). \"There seems to be some adaptation made in the ransom notes,\" Lechtik told Bleeping Computer, suggesting this particular detail adds up to the assumption that Ryuk is deployed after hackers infect networks and not via mass email spam. \"This could imply there may be two levels of offensive,\" Check Point said, suggesting that the Ryuk gang may also deploy different Ryuk samples based on the organization they manage to infect, and their ability to pay higher ransom fees. Ryuk not decryptable at the time of writing As for the ransomware's encryption, this is a classic AES-RSA combo that's usually undecryptable unless the Ryuk team made mistakes in its implementation. Currently, researchers have not spotted such weakness in Ryuk, as of yet. Similar to most elite ransomware strains, unique Bitcoin payment addresses are created for each victim. Check Point says that money doesn't stay too much in these addresses, and they are quickly split and laundered through different accounts. While previous versions of the Hermes ransomware have been an on-and-off threat that surfaces at random intervals with a mass spam campaign, the new Ryuk ransomware strain appears to be a new attempt from the Lazarus Group at developing a SamSam-like strain to use in precise surgical strikes against selected organizations.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: asked, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom fees demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: asked for, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay higher ransom fees, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

While this new campaign is using a name to identify itself, these types of attacks are not new and MongoDB databases have been targeted for a while now. These hijacks work by attackers scanning the Internet or using services such as Shodan.io to search for unprotected MongoDB servers. Once connected, the attackers may export the databases, delete them, and then create a ransom note explaining how to get the databases back. According to security researcher Bob Diachenko who discovered the new Mongo Lock campaign, the attackers will connect to an unprotected database and delete it. In its place, the attackers will leave a new database called \"Warning\" with a collection inside it named \"Readme\". The Readme collection will contain a ransom note that explains that the database has been encrypted and that the victims need to pay them a ransom to get it back. In the Mongo Lock campaign, as shown below, the attackers do not leave a bitcoin address, but rather direct the victim's to contact them via email. While the ransom note claims that the attackers are exporting the database first before deleting it, it is not known if they are doing that in ever case. Victims are paying ransoms When looking up some of the bitcoin addresses used in recent MongoDB attacks, victims have been paying the ransoms.  For example, the bitcoin address 3FAVraz3ovC1pz4frGRH6XXCuqPSWeh3UH, which has been used often, has had 3 ransom payments for a total of 1.8 bitcoins.

But the borough, home to about 106,000 people outside Anchorage, still has many services to restore, prompting its elected officials last week to approve a disaster declaration in the cyberattack\u2019s wake.   The declaration could make the borough eligible for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Meanwhile, local government systems are slowly blinking back online. In its most recent updates, the borough says it\u2019s restored departments\u2019 phone servers and that full email service is expected within a week. But other systems are still being rebuilt after the borough\u2019s encounter with the ransomware known as BitPaymer, which locked down systems ranging from main file servers to the card-swipe mechanisms that control doors in government buildings. BitPaymer is a complex cocktail of malware that enters a targeted system through a Trojan horse, then lies dormant until it\u2019s noticed and authorized users attempt to remove it, at which point it locks up the system with a demand for a sum of money payable in bitcoin.  \u201cAll of the pieces of this are the absolute worst in the world, and they have all been combined together and put on us at one time,\u201d borough IT Director Eric Wyatt says in a recent YouTube video about the response to the cyberattack. In the case of Mat-Su, as the borough is known to residents, Wyatt has said the Trojan component likely arrived as early as May 3, more than two months before an attempted anti-virus sweep triggered the ransom demand. According to evidence found during the initial investigation of the attack, Mat-Su was at least the 210th victim of the BitPaymer package since it was first unleashed in June 2017. This week, it possibly found its latest victim in the Professional Golfers Association, employees of which found themselves locked out of their systems on the eve of the prestigious PGA Championship. According to the cybersecurity research website BleepingComputer , the attack on the PGA resembles the one that hit Mat-Su.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: were knocked out, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: encounter, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a demand for a sum of money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

In order to regain access to its data, the regional municipality of Mekinac was told to deposit eight units of the digital currency Bitcoin into a bank account \u2014 roughly equivalent to $65,000. Mekinac\u2019s IT department eventually negotiated the cyber extortionists down and paid $30,000 in Bitcoin, but not before the region\u2019s servers were disabled for about two weeks. The attack highlights the inability of many small municipalities to adequately protect their data, but also the lack of guidance on cybersecurity provided to them by the Quebec government, according to Prof. Jose Fernandez, a malware expert at Montreal\u2019s Polytechnique engineering school. \u201cQuebec is an embarrassment,\u201d Fernandez said in an interview, adding that he has tried without success to contact government representatives to alert them to the problem. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been any traction on this issue in the past 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI try to speak to (the government) but there is nobody. Who are you going to call? Nobody.\u201d  Bernard Thompson, reeve for the Mekinac regional municipality, said the ransom demand presented a real dilemma for his small organization. Mekinac groups together 10 municipalities with a population of roughly 13,000 people. \u201cIt was hard, clearly, on the moral side of things that we had to pay a bunch of bandits,\u201d Thompson said. Mekinac\u2019s attackers used malicious software \u2014 known as malware or ransomware \u2014 to demand money in return for keys to unlock the data. Fernandez said it is ironic that Quebec is home to a thriving cybersecurity industry and is an emerging hub for artificial-intelligence research, yet the provincial government is \u201cdecades\u201d behind other provinces in defending against cyberattacks.  Still, Quebec is not the only province experiencing attacks. Several municipal governments and businesses in Ontario were recently hit by ransomware attacks, prompting the Ontario Provincial Police to issue an advisory in September. In response to the growing problem, Communications Security Establishment \u2014 the Defence Department\u2019s electronic intelligence agency \u2014 launched the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security last month.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: notifying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was told to deposit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: negotiated, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit by ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Spokesman Evan Koronewski said the centre has no provincial or territorial equivalent. Fernandez, however, notes that some provinces are taking significant steps. British Columbia and New Brunswick have established offices dedicated to protecting government data. Meanwhile in Quebec, he said, small towns are left unprotected. \u201cI\u2019m hoping the new government does something about it,\u201d he said. Patrick Harvey, spokesman for the Public Security Department, disputed the claim the provincial government is unprepared for cyberattacks. He said the Treasury Department has a director of information responsible for ensuring government data is protected. The Public Security Department has a unit dedicated to responding to cyberattacks within the administration and provincial police. But municipalities are not part of the unit\u2019s mandate. \u201cMunicipalities are autonomous entities that are responsible for ensuring the security of their digital infrastructure,\u201d Harvey said. Mekinac\u2019s servers were compromised after an employee opened and clicked on a link in a fraudulent email sent by the hackers. Once opened, the malware was downloaded onto the computer, giving the hackers access to the entire network. The hackers then encrypted all the data and held it hostage until they received their bitcoins. Once a system\u2019s data is encrypted, it\u2019s virtually impossible to crack the code without a key \u2014 and there is nothing police can do about it. Most professional criminals use commercial grade encryption and to locate a key to decrypt data would take \u201castronomical effort in terms of computing,\u201d Fernandez said. \u201cYou either pay or you don\u2019t get the data.\u201d The identity and location of Mekinac\u2019s hackers were never discovered. Thompson said police seized some of his computers for analysis and told his office not to negotiate or pay the criminals.  But Thompson said his region couldn\u2019t heed that advice, because it would have meant months of data re-entry, costing significantly more than $30,000. So they paid, got their data back and learned a valuable lesson. \u201cIn the end, in terms of the security of our system, (the attack) was actually positive,\u201d Thompson said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The update was originally released to prevent a zero-day attack on IE. Per Microsoft, this was the issue being fixed:      A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.     In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and then convince a user to view the website, for example, by sending an email.     The security update addresses the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles objects in memory. But now that fix is causing a pretty big problem of its own: it\u2019s preventing certain laptops from booting. The affected machines are part of a pretty small bunch\u2014only Lenovo laptops with less than 8 GB of RAM running the 2016 Anniversary Update (1607)\u2014but it\u2019s still a pretty bad problem to have. Fortunately, there\u2019s a way to bypass the failed boot by restarting into the UEFI and disabling Secure Boot. It\u2019s also noted that if BitLocker is enabled that you may have to go through BitLocker recovery after disabling Secure Boot.  On the upside, Microsoft is working with Lenovo to correct the issue and will release a fix sometime in the future. I just wouldn\u2019t count on it before the end of the year. Until then, be careful when updating devices, especially if they happen to be Lenovo laptops with limited RAM.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has seen, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: exists in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is designed, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: convince, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: addresses, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: correct, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Patches for the three flaws \u2013 CVE-2018-16864, CVE-2018-16865, and CVE-2018-16866 \u2013 should appear in distro repos soon as a result of coordinated disclosure. However, Linux distributions such as Debian remain vulnerable at the moment, depending on the version you have installed. \"They're aware of the issues and they're releasing patches,\" said Jimmy Graham, director of product management at Qualys, in a phone interview with The Register. \"I don't believe Red Hat has released one but it should be coming shortly.\" The bugs were found in systemd-journald, a part of systemd that handles the collection and storage of log data. The first two CVEs refer to memory corruption flaws while the third involves an out of bounds error that can leak data. CVE-2018-16864 can be exploited by malware running on a Linux box, or a malicious logged-in user, to crash and potentially hijack the systemd-journald system service, elevating access from user to root. CVE-2018-16865 and CVE-2018-16866 can be exploited together by a local attacker to crash or hijack the root-privileged journal service. While systemd isn't universally beloved in the Linux community, Graham sees nothing unusual about the presence of the three flaws in the software. \"The noteworthiness to me is that it is very commonly found in most major distributions,\" he said. Qualys contends all systemd-based Linux distros are vulnerable, though the vulnerabilities cannot be exploited in SUSE Linux Enterprise 15, openSUSE Leap 15.0, and Fedora 28 and 29 because their user-land code is compiled with GCC's -fstack-clash-protection option. The security biz calls it a simplified stack clash \u2013 where the size of the stack gets changed to overlap with other memory areas \u2013 because it only requires the last two steps in a four step process: Clashing the stack with another memory region, moving the stack-pointer to the stack start, jumping over the stack guard-page into another memory region, and smashing the stack or memory space.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: appear in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: remain vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: aware, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: releasing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

This according to researchers with security shop Exodus Intel, who claim that CVE-2018-6661 was not fully addressed with either of the two patches McAfee released for it. The flaw is an elevation of privilege issue in McAfee's TrueKey password manager. An exploit can be carried out on a guest account by side-loading a specially-crafted DLL into True Key that would then allow for commands and code to be executed with system-level privileges. McAfee's summary of the flaw, published on March 30, lists it as a 'high' severity issue that was patched in version 4.20.110 - which was released in April. Exodus says that the April release didn't fully fix the bug, however. The researchers explain that McAfee's patch only addresses one of the libraries (SDKLibAdapter) that would allow the attack to take place, with another DLL (NLog logging library) being left vulnerable to the same side-loading tactic. \"The patch is incomplete because it overlooks this and hence the nlog.dll can be utilized to allow arbitrary code execution just as the McAfee.TrueKey.SDKLibAdapter.dll could be used in versions prior to the patch,\" Exodus researchers Omar El-Domeiri and Gaurav Baruah said. \"Furthermore, any other McAfee signed binary can be used to exploit the vulnerability as long as the binary depends on a DLL outside the list of known DLLs.\" Exodus said that it notified McAfee of the issue back in August, prompting a second patch that, unfortunately, also failed to fully remedy the issue. \"However, we tested the latest version available (5.1.173.1 as of September 7th, 2018) and found that it remains vulnerable requiring no changes to our exploit.\" To its credit, McAfee acknowledged the issue and said it is still working to fully resolve the flaw. \"McAfee has been working with the researchers to confirm their findings, and has provided customers mitigation guidance to allow them to protect themselves until the company can address the reported issues via automatic product updates,\" McAfee told The Register.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: claim, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addresses, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being left vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: notified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: prompting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: remedy, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: remains vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: acknowledged, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: resolve, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: confirm, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The 10.14 incarnation of macOS, known as Mojave, has been released into general availability. It includes new features, interface updates, and security patches \u2013 though at least one hole was left unpatched.  Apple is touting a set of interface improvements with the update, most notably the addition of a \"Dark Mode\" color scheme option and a Dynamic Desktop background that changes the image with the time of day. In more useful features, there's the Stacks utility that organizes messy desktops by grouping files into categories. Apple also added a set of new News, Stocks, Voice Memos, and Home applications for macOS, porting the tools from iOS, while the Mac Continuity Camera app will let users snap and share pictures from their iOS device. Apple also redesigned the macOS version of the App Store service.  Nestled into the Mojave update was a patch bundle that addresses more than a half-dozen security holes. Mojave will include fixes for eight CVE-listed vulnerabilities. These include two remote code execution flaws in the kernel (CVE-2018-4336, CVE-2018-4344) and weak RC4 encryption (CVE-2016-1777). That '4344 flaw was discovered by eggheads at the UK government's eavesdropping nerve center, GCHQ. Other flaws include a traffic intercept flaw in Bluetooth (CVE-2018-5383), a sandbox escape in the operation firewall (CVE-2018-4353), a restricted memory access flaw in Crash Reporter (CVE-2018-4333), and flaws in both Auto Unlock (CVE-2018-4321) and App Store (CVE-2018-4324) that would allow an attacker to access the user's Apple ID.  Seemingly, these patches are only available for macOS 10.14 \u2013 however, previous versions of the operating system were fixed up last week.  It didn't take long for at least one researcher to blast holes in the security features of the new operating system.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has been released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: left unpatched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addresses, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are only available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Although most Google devices \u2014 including older Nexus devices \u2014 received the patch at the beginning of the month as detailed below, the original Pixel lineup was left high and dry. Today, finally, the patch is here. You can wait for the OTA to hit your device, or you can use the links below to manually install. We\u2019re not quite sure why this took so long, but hopefully, the December patch will be a bit more uniform. Right on schedule, Google has released Android\u2019s October security patch. As it\u2019s the first update to make its way to the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL, it should include some bug fixes. Unfortunately, it won\u2019t resolve the memory issues just yet. The November patch itself includes fixes for 17 security vulnerabilities. The most severe bugs included an issue in the media framework and the ability for a  remote attacker to execute arbitrary code through a crafted file. Fortunately, Google doesn\u2019t believe that either of these were used to harm users. The November security patch includes several bug fixes and improvements specifically for Pixel devices. As Google notes, this update should help with notification stability on Pixel 2 and Pixel 3 handsets as well as improve picture-in-picture performance on the four handsets. Sadly, the November security patch will likely be the last update pushed to the Pixel C, Nexus 6P, and Nexus 5X. As Google only guarantees firmware upgrades for two years after a device is released and security patches for three, the search giant is no longer obligated to support the two phone or tablet. Of course, this doesn\u2019t mean that your devices are no longer usable. Even if you no longer get official support from Google, there are large developer communities that build ROMs that brings the latest security patches and Android features to all of Google\u2019s abandoned devices. If you don\u2019t want to wait for the November security patch to make its way to your phone, you can download the latest factory image or OTA file from the links below. From there, you can either flash a fresh build to your phone or sideload the OTA update.

Paul Davis, retail fraud director at Lloyds Banking Group, told Money Mail criminals can mimic the exact format of messages \u2013 which appear as though they are sent from a bank\u2019s number using a technique called \u2018spoofing\u2019. With fake banking texts now so difficult to spot, Mr Davis said customers should be taught how to respond to them to avoid being lured into a scam. He added: \u2018It\u2019s the new \u201cdon\u2019t talk to strangers\u201d.  'We teach children how to cross the road and we also need to teach everyone how to be aware of and stay safe from scams.  It\u2019s the new basic life safety advice we all need to know.\u2019 Mr Davis said the key to avoiding falling for scams was to treat all messages with caution.  \u2018It\u2019s about what you say when you reply,\u2019 he said. \u2018Don\u2019t ever give out your bank details and never give more than a simple answer like yes or no.\u2019 The context of messages could be crucial, he explained. For example, when shopping online, if a customer is texted at the same time to confirm they intended to make this exact purchase, it is more likely to be genuine.  But if a person receives a text out of the blue saying they have made a payment and can they confirm the purchase, it is more likely to be a scam. Mr Davis accepted it was hard to know what messages to trust because even genuine ones can appear suspicious if they come from a variety of numbers. \u2018If in doubt, don\u2019t reply and ring the number on the back of your card,\u2019 he said. Customers were also warned never to click on links in texts or open email attachments claiming to be from the bank, as this could download malware which can spy on their phone or computer to find out their password.

There is currently no obligation on banks to reimburse customers who authorise payment in this type of fraud \u2013 and many say the victim is to blame for allowing the transaction to go through. But consumer campaigners argue most scams are now so sophisticated even the savviest customers can fall for them. Mr Davis said Lloyds examined each case on an individual basis and \u2018often\u2019 refunded victims as a gesture of goodwill.  He said: \u2018The key to stopping this type of fraud is working together. There\u2019s a shared responsibility.

Banks should also delay payments if they are concerned they may be fraudulent and refund vulnerable victims, such as those who have been recently bereaved \u2013 even if the bank was not at fault. But there was no agreement on who should bankroll the cost of refunds for victims \u2013 and some campaigners criticised the code for not going far enough.

That doesn't mean that phishing -- one of the most common means of performing cyber-attacks -- is any less dangerous, but a faster approach to dealing with the issue is starting to hinder attacks. Deceptive domain names look like those of authentic services, so that somebody who clicks on a malicious link may not realise they aren't visiting the real website of the organisation being spoofed. One of the most common agencies to be imitated by cyber-attackers around the world is that of government tax collectors. The idea behind such attacks is that people will be tricked into believing they are owed money by emails claiming to be from the taxman. However, no payment ever comes, and if a victim falls for such an attack, they're only going to lose money when their bank details are stolen, and they can even have their personal information compromised. In order to combat phishing and other forms of cyber-attack, the UK's National Cyber Crime Centre -- the internet security arm of GCHQ -- launched what it called the Active Cyber Defence programme a year ago. It appears to have some success in its first 12 months because, despite a rise in registered fraudulent domains, the lifespan of a phishing URL has been reduced and the number of global phishing attacks being carried out by UK-hosted sites has declined from five percent to three percent. The figures are laid out in a new NCSC report: Active Cyber Defence - One Year On. During that time, 121,479 phishing sites hosted in the UK, and 18,067 worldwide spoofing UK government, were taken down, with many of them purporting to be HMRC and linked to phishing emails in the form of tax refund scams.  An active approach to dealing with phishing domains has also led to a reduction in the amount of time these sites are active, potentially limiting cybercriminal campaigns before they can gain any real traction. Prior to the launch of the program, the average time a phishing website spoofing a UK government website remained active was for 42 hours -- or almost two days.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: look like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: being spoofed, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: be imitated, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: will be tricked, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claiming to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: are stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: spoofing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: purporting to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: spoofing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

However, while this does mean there's less time for the attackers to steal information or finances, it doesn't mean that they're not successful in carrying out attacks. The increased number of registered domains for carrying out phishing attacks shows that crooks are happy to work a little bit harder in order to reap the rewards of campaigns -- and the NCSC isn't under any illusion that the job of protecting internet users is anywhere near complete. \"The ACD programme intends to increase our cyber adversaries' risk and reduces their return on investment to protect the majority of people in the UK from cyber attacks,\" said Dr Ian Levy, technical director of the NCSC. \"The results we have published today are positive, but there is a lot more work to be done. The successes we have had in our first year will cause attackers to change their behaviour and we will need to adapt.\" A focus on taking down HMRC and other government-related domains has helped UK internet users, but cyber-attacks aren't limited by borders, with many malicious IPs hosted in practically every country used to carry out cyber-attacks around the world -- meaning every country should be playing a part. \"Obviously, phishing and web-inject attacks are not connected to the UK's IP space and most campaigns of these types are hosted elsewhere.

These weren't your garden-variety spam posts either, but rather, fraudsters were hacking into the verified accounts of celebrities and brands in an attempt to lure unsuspecting victims. But it looks like these crypto-scammers are moving on and are now targeting other social media platforms, as well. This time, they're gaming Facebook's official sponsored ad system to fool eager people who are looking to make a quick profit. Read on and see what this new scheme is all about. Cybercriminals are relentlessly coming up with new tactics all the time, and it's always good to be aware of their latest schemes. This new ploy is a classic phishing scam that's meant to steal your personal information like your name, email and credit card numbers. And similar to other elaborate phishing scams, these cybercriminals created a bunch of fake websites, news articles and ads for that purpose.  The whole ploy starts with a fake Facebook sponsored ad promoting an easy \"wealth building\" scheme. Accompanying the post is an embedded report that appears to originate from the news site CNBC. If you take the bait and click through the ad, the ruse gets more obvious. First, the link's web address doesn't belong to any CNBC domain. However, the fraudsters mimicked the look and feel of the real CNBC site so there's a chance an unsuspecting eye might get duped. But yes sir, the entire news article is completely fraudulent, the fakest of fake news. Basically, it states that Singapore has officially adopted a certain cryptocurrency and has anointed a firm, dubbed the CashlessPay Group, to market and purchase it. Nevermind that CashlessPay sounds just like another third-rate pyramid scheme, but let's go along for the ride, shall we? You probably know by now that there are tons of bogus information going on in Facebook at any given time. The social media giant is trying to clean up its act, though. If you can recall, Facebook banned blockchain and cryptocurrency ads earlier this year but softened its stance by allowing pre-approved cryptocurrency advertisers to post sponsored ads.

The group is believed to have a background in legitimate infosec activities and access to documentation specific to the financial sector. The fraudulent emails purported to come from the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) and contained a malicious attachment. The message body lured the recipients to open the attachment in order to check the latest details on the \"standardization of the format of CBR's electronic communications.\" Email authentication mechanism saves the day International cybersecurity company Group-IB investigated the attack and noticed that the style and format of the fake communication were very similar to the official CBR correspondence. This supports the theory that the attackers had access to legitimate emails from CBR. If Silence hackers have any ties with the legal side of reverse engineering and penetration testing, it is very likely that they are familiar with the documentation used by financial institutions and with how banking systems work. In a report published today, Group-IB says that the attackers spoofed the sender's email address but the messages did not pass the DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) validation. DKIM is a solution specifically designed to prevent forged email addresses by adding to the message a signature that confirms its authenticity. Banks see more spear-phishing from a different group The Silence hackers are not the only ones trying their spear-phishing game on Russian banks. On October 23, another notorious group, MoneyTaker, ran a similar campaign against the same type of targets. Their message spoofed an email address from the Financial Sector Computer Emergency Response Team (FinCERT) and contained five attachments disguised as documents from CBR. \"Three out of five files were empty decoy documents, but two contained a download for the Meterpreter Stager. To carry out the attack, hackers used self-signed SSL certificates,\" says Rustam Mirkasymov, Group-IB Head of Dynamic Analysis of malware department and threat intelligence expert. These clues, along with server infrastructure associated with the MoneyTaker group, allowed the security experts to identify the perpetrator. As in the case of Silence, this attacker is also thought to have had access to CBR documents, most likely from compromised inboxes of Russian banks employees.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: purported to come, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lured, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: had access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: spoofed, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: spear-phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: their spear-phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: spoofed, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: disguised as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: have had access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Silence and MoneyTaker are the most dangerous threats to banks According to Group-IB, multiple groups use the Central Bank of Russia in spear-phishing operations, and for good reason, since the organization dictates regulations to financial institutions in the country and maintains a constant communication flow with them. Mirkasymov says that Silence and MoneyTaker are the most dangerous of all groups that threaten financial organizations. Referring to the latter, the expert says that its repertoire also includes drive-by attacks and testing the network for vulnerabilities. The goal is to access the internal nodes that enable them to withdraw money from ATMs, process cards or interbank transfers.

Sweepstakes, lottery and prize scams \u201care among the most serious and pervasive frauds operating today,\u201d according to a new report from the Better Business Bureau. And along with phone calls, letters and email, the crooks are now using text messages, pop-ups and phony Facebook messages to lure their victims.

They mutate and adapt and find things that work,\u201d said Steve Baker, former director of the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s Midwest region and author of the BBB report. \u201cThe crooks have discovered social media big time and since social media is free to use, they can easily do a whole lot of damage from other countries.\u201d The BBB study found that:     Nearly 500,000 people reported a sweepstakes, lottery or other prize scam to law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and Canada in the last three years.     Monetary losses totaled $117 million last year. Facebook Messenger Lottery Fraud Scammers are creating bogus websites that look like a legitimate lottery or sweepstakes site. Or they are reaching out to potential victims who don\u2019t properly set their privacy settings on social media platforms such as Facebook. The BBB report says Facebook Messenger, the private messaging app, is a favorite way for fraudsters to find victims.

Phishing scams aim to trick staff into handing over data -- normally usernames and passwords -- by posing as legitimate email. It's a technique used by the lowliest criminals as part of ransomware campaigns, right up to state-backed hackers because it continues to be such an effective method. In a review of 100 simulated attack campaigns for 48 of its clients, accounting for almost a million individual users, security company MWR Infosecurity found that sending a bogus friend request was the best way to get someone to click on a link -- even when the email was being sent to a work email address. Almost a quarter of users clicked the link to be taken through to a fake login screen, with more than half going on to provide a username and password, and four out of five then going on to download a file. A spoof email claiming to be from the HR department referring to the appraisal system was also very effective: nearly one in five clicked the link, and three-quarters provided more credentials, with a similar percentage going on to download a file. Some might argue that gaining access to a staff email account is of limited use, but the security company argues that this is a handy for an assault. A hacker could dump entire mailboxes, access file shares, run programs on the compromised user's device, and access multiple systems, warned MWR InfoSecurity. Even basic security controls, such as two-factor authentication or disabling file and SharePoint remote access, could reduce the risk. The company also reported bad news about the passwords that users handed over: while over 60 percent of passwords were found to have a length of 8 to 10 characters -- the mandatory minimum for many organizations -- the company argued that this illustrates how users stick to minimum security requirements. A third of the passwords consisted of an upper-case first letter, a series of lower-case letters, and then numbers with no symbols. It also found that 13.6 percent of passwords ended with four numbers in the range of 1940 to 2040. Of those, nearly half ended in 2016, which means one-in-twenty of all passwords end with the year in which they were created.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing scams, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: pretending to come from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: fool, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: Phishing scams, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: posing as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: being sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claiming to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: gaining access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: could dump, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

You\u2019re not the only one. Action Fraud, the UK police\u2019s dedicated fraud tracking team, has revealed a significant increase in reports about phishing attacks connected to TSB\u2019s massive IT outage have been reported. A total of 176 complaints have been received, or around ten a day since April 30. \u201cThere has been an uptick in phishing attempts across the piece,\u201d says an Action Fraud spokesperson. TSB\u2019s banking meltdown, caused by a botched IT upgrade, still has not been remedied \u2013 nearly four weeks on. And the crisis has become paydirt for scammers and hackers, who have waded into a confusing, chaotic situation and are making out with thousands of pounds worth of savings from people\u2019s accounts. And it\u2019s not just TSB - the number of phishing texts claiming to be from other banks such as Barclays and NatWest also seems to be on the rise. \u201cWhen a \u2018change\u2019 goes wrong and so publicly like TSB\u2019s, it\u2019s like cyber blood in the water,\u201d explains Ian Thornton-Trump, chief technical officer of Octopi Managed Services, an IT company. \u201cCyber criminals pay attention to companies rocked by internal scandals or public \u2018ball drops\u2019 and react accordingly.\u201d With the bank\u2019s staff overloaded trying to fix the problems that caused the outage in the first place, fraudulent transactions aren\u2019t being tracked or checked as quickly as they should be. \u201cIt is a sad fact that fraudsters might try to take advantage of situations like these,\u201d says a TSB spokesperson.

The authorities dismissed the ransom demand and decided to rebuild the affected systems. For two days, flight status information was displayed on whiteboards and there was an increase in announcements over the speakers. Similarly, in the last few months there have been several cyberattacks targeting hospitals, city administration and sporting events. The servers of the US-based PGA were reportedly hit by ransomware attacks right before the PGA Championship in the first week of August. A new ransomware called Everlasting Blue Blackmail Virus, which targets Windows PCs using spam and phishing campaigns, flashes former US President Barrack Obama\u2019s image with the ransom message. Once the ransomware gains entry into the system, its looks for all .exe (executable) files and encrypts them, preventing users from running apps until the ransom is paid. Hot on the heels of the cyberattack on the town of Valdez in Alaska, Canadian town Midland in Ontario was hit by a ransomware attack in the first week of September. Hackers broke into the city database involving fire, water, and waste management and blocked access, demanding ransom. A major concern for cybersecurity experts is the fileless attacks, which are hard to detect. These attacks do not install a malicious software to infiltrate a victim\u2019s computer, which makes it difficult for anti-virus solutions to detect them. According to Ponemon Institute, 35% of all cyberattacks in 2018 were fileless, while security solution provider Carbon Black claims that fileless attacks accounted for 50% of all successful data breaches targeting financial businesses. Fileless attacks target legitimate Windows tools such as PowerShell (a scripting language which can provide hackers unrestricted access to Windows API) and Windows Management Instrumentation (used by admins). By latching on to these tools, hackers gain control over the PC and eventually the organization\u2019s database. In another recent development, researchers at F-Secure have come across a new vulnerability affecting PCs. Dubbed as cold boot, the attack can be carried off using a special programme through a USB drive connected to a PC. Using the programme, the hacker can disable the memory overwriting by rebooting the system, without a proper shutdown. The attack can be used to break into company system which might have access to the company network.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit by ransomware, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: phishing campaigns, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: the ransom is paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the cyberattack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was hit by a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

According to The Edge Markets, which initially broke the news, the hackers struck on November 8 consequently denying the company\u2019s employees access to the email system. The hackers are now demanding 1,000 bitcoins, translating to approximately US$6.3 million at current market prices, to reauthorize access. Media Prima did not, however, confirm the attack though sources indicated that the publicly listed company would not be paying the ransom. Sources also told The Edge Markets that with access to the office email denied, the media giant had migrated to G Suite, a Google product hosted offsite. It was also not immediately clear whether the company which owns four TV stations, four radio stations and three national newspapers among other media assets had lodged a complaint with the police. Lucrative Business While extortionists have been targeting individuals in the recent past especially by threatening to reveal the porn-viewing habits of their victims, it has generally been more lucrative to target businesses. According to a report by cybersecurity firm Sophos, the SamSam ransomware, which has mostly targeted business enterprises and public bodies, has, for instance, generated its creators bitcoin worth more than US$6 million since it emerged three years ago. Some of the high-profile victims of ransomware attacks in the recent past have included the Port of San Diego.

The utility said customer information was not compromised in the attack, but many of databases will have to be recreated in their entirety. OWNASA said it is coordinating with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the state of North Carolina,  and several technology security companies in response to the attack. The safety of the public\u2019s water supply and the area\u2019s environment are not in danger, the utility said. ONWASA began experiencing persistent virus attacks from a polymorphic malware known as EMOTET on October 4. The virus was thought to be under control, but when it persisted ONWASA brought in outside security specialists.  The specialist continued to work the problem with ONWASA Information Technology (IT) staff.  At what ONWASA officials said may have been a timed event, the malware launched a sophisticated virus known as RYUK at 3 a.m. on Saturday. An ONWASA IT staffer saw the attack and immediately disconnected ONWASA from the internet. However, the crypto-virus spread quickly along the network, encrypting databases and files.  The attack is similar in nature to those experienced by Atlanta, Georgia and Mecklenburg County.  lONWASA said it had mulitple layers of computer protection in place, including firewalls and malware/anti-virus software.  The defenses of the computer systems at the main office were penetrated.  ONWASA has received one email from the cybercriminals, who it said may be based in a foreign country.  The email is consistent with ransomware attacks of other governments and corporations.  OWNASA officials said ransom monies \u201cwould be used to fund criminal, and perhaps terrorist activities in other countries. Furthermore, there is no expectation that payment of a ransom would forestall repeat attacks. ONWASA will not negotiate with criminals nor bow to their demands. The FBI agrees that ransoms should not be paid. ONWASA will undertake the painstaking process of rebuilding its databases and computer systems from the ground up.\u201d The lack of computing ability will affect the timeliness of service from ONWASA for several weeks to come.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was hit by a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was not compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payment of a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransoms should not be paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

It may sound like a movie plot but ransomware attacks like these are on the rise. According to their 2017 Internet Crime report, last year the FBI received 1,783 complaints identified as ransomware. The adjusted losses from the attacks was over $2.3 million. An example of a ransomware attack is software that downloads to your computer, encrypts your data and then demands money to get it back. It's technological extortion, essentially. And that's what happened to Wendell's Furniture in Colchester at the end of last month. \"Our servers crashed and when our IT guy came to take care of the problem, I asked him how the patient was doing and he just got kind of an ashen look on his face and he just shook his head and I knew we were in trouble,\" said Ryan Farrell, the vice president of Wendell's Furniture. Farrell says in their nearly 20 years of business, they've never had this type of cybersecurity attack. \"I honestly don't think I believed it to begin with. It's something you see in the movies, something you see on TV but it's never something that I thought would happen to us, especially here in Vermont,\" Farrell said. The company's sales information from the last 5-10 years was stolen, including customers' names, addresses, phone numbers and email addresses. However, no credit card numbers were part of the breach. \"My message to customers is not to panic, don't be worried about your information,\" Farrell said. \"Just know that it's going to take us just a little bit more time to get your sofa to you but we're open for business.\" Wendell's was able to recover most of the data but not all of it. They are still missing several months' worth of data. \"Everything that used to be easy is now really hard,\" Farrell said. A McAfee report shows that ransomware attacks are up more than 100 percent in the second quarter of 2018 over that same time frame in 2016. Duane Dunston teaches cybersecurity at Champlain College and says these attacks can be hard to count. \"It's not really clear because many organizations may not report it,\" he said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was attacked, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: held for ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demands money, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The ransomware is a virulent computer malware, which attacks by spreading from one computer to another and locking up the access to the network servers. The ransomware also encrypts the documents and then demands ransom for providing a key to unlock encrypted files. In March 2016, the previous occasion when the ransomware attacked, the district cancelled the school for one day so as to let the technology staff have time for recovering from the malware. During that attack, the district servers as well as over 600 computers got infected badly. The current attack took place during the summer vacation, and was not as harmful as of last time. As per staff report from T.J. Smith, Cloquet School District Technology Director, the virus has encrypted files available on all the servers except one, this included the network shared drives. However, the attack does not indicate stealing of any information. The virus only encrypted the files, so that the users were not able to open them. Board members of Cloquet School were explained by Smith on 13 Aug, 2018, that the district only was left with two options other than succumbing to the demands of ransom by the hacker - one, trying to recover data with a probability that the data may not be retrieved and then it would be a complete waste of money and time. The second option was to plan out the way of recreating the data and rebuilding the affected servers. Smith, however, advocated for second option as the data lost was not so important and the insurance will help in paying out for recovering the infected servers. Unanimously, the board members also voted for second option, which is recreating the data and rebuilding the affected servers. Besides, the board members suggested hiring a \"forensic\" company to investigate on the ransomware attack and determine the source from where the virus has entered. On a brighter side, Smith revealed that the technology staffs have been able to recover some of the lost data, and they are also capable of recreating the data that is unrecoverable. He also commented that the process of recovery will not at any cost affect the commencement of the school session in the month of September.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has been hit by a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demands ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stealing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the demands of ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The company said that it has uncovered evidence that about 880,000 payment cards were possibly impacted, along with other personal information, like names, payment card information, dates of birth, phone numbers, email addresses, physical and/or billing addresses and gender. The company said evidence suggests an attacker may have accessed information stored on a legacy e-commerce platform during two periods: 1 January through 22 June 2016 and 1 October to 22 December 2017. \"We determined on March 1, 2018, that there was evidence suggesting that an attacker may have accessed personal information stored on this consumer and business partner platform,\u201d the Expedia-owned site said in a media statement. \u201cWe took immediate steps to investigate the incident and enhance security and monitoring of the affected platform. To date, we do not have direct evidence that this personal information was actually taken from the platform. We deeply regret the incident, and we are committed to doing everything we can to maintain the trust of our customers and partners.\" Mike Schuricht, vice president of product management at Bitglass, said that the issue may have arisen as an artifact of the acquisition integration.

Verizon Communications suffered a major data leak due to a misconfigured cloud server that exposed data on 6 million of its customers. The leak was the result of its third-party provider NICE Systems incorrectly configuring Verizon's cloud-based file repository housed in an Amazon Web Services S3 bucket on NICE's cloud server, according to UpGuard, which issued a report on the breach today. Verizon customer names, addresses, account information, including account personal identification numbers (PINs), were compromised. UpGuard in its data estimated that up to 14 million customer records were exposed, but Verizon stated that data on 6 million of its users was affected. In one file alone, there were 6,000 PINs that were publicly exposed, according to Dan O'Sullivan, a cyber resilience analyst for UpGuard.  What's unique about this leak is that it was not just personal data that was publicly exposed but also PINs, according to O'Sullivan. \"The PINs are used to identify a customer to a customer care person,\" O'Sullivan says, noting that an attacker could impersonate the user by using the PIN and then gain access to that individual's account. Verizon issued a statement acknowledging the public exposure of its customer data, but stressed that no loss or theft of Verizon or Verizon customer information occurred. The telecom giant also noted: \"To the extent PINs were included in the data set, the PINs are used to authenticate a customer calling our wireline call center, but do not provide online access to customer accounts,\" Verizon stated. \"An employee of one of our vendors put information into a cloud storage area and incorrectly set the storage to allow external access,\" Verizon said. How it Went Down NICE was hired to help Verizon improve its residential and small business wireline self-service call center portal, according to Verizon's statement. As part of this project, NICE needed certain data that included a limited amount of personal and cell phone number information. None of the information stored for the project included social security numbers, according to Verizon.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data leak, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: this leak, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: loss or theft, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Vickery was able to fully download the repository because it was configured to be publicly accessible to anyone entering the S3 URL. Following the discovery, UpGuard contacted Verizon on June 13 to inform the telecom giant of the data leakage and then on June 22 the exposure was sealed up, according to UpGuard's report. \"There was a fairly long duration of time before it was fixed, which is troubling,\" O'Sullivan says. Verizon is not the first company to encounter data leakage as a result of permissions set to public rather than private on Amazon's S3 bucket. Earlier this year, UpGuard also discovered a similar situation that involved the Republican National Committee (RNC), which left millions of voter records exposed on the cloud account. As in the Verizon case, the RNC relied on a third party vendor to handle its cloud storage needs and it too used Amazon's AWS S3. That third-party also improperly set the database to public rather than private. \"The number one thing to keep in mind if you are a CISO is evaluating your third-party vendors. You can have the best security in the world and the best visibility into your systems, but if you pass it onto a third-party vendor without checking out how well they handle their security, then you have done that all in vain,\" O'Sullivan says. \"Verizon did not own the server that was involved here, but it will own the consequences.\" Rich Campagna, CEO of Bitglass, stressed the importance of security teams ensuring services used are configured securely. \"This massive data leak could have been avoided by using specific data-centric security tools, which can ensure appropriate configuration of cloud services, deny unauthorized access, and encrypt sensitive data at rest,\" Campagna said in a statement.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: the data leakage, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data leakage, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data leak, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: unauthorized access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The company says that a yet to be identified attacker (or attackers) has gained access to the infrastructure hosting its website \u2014 Forrester.com. Forrester is using this website to allow customers to log in and download research specific to their contracts. The company provides statistics, trends, and other market research, which clients use to take decisions before launching new products or business endeavors. Attacker stole site credentials and stole proprietary research Steven Peltzman, Forrester's Chief Business Technology Officer, says the attacker stole valid Forrester.com user credentials that gave him access to Forrester.com accounts. \"The hacker used that access to steal research reports made available to our clients,\" he said. \"There is no evidence that confidential client data, financial information, or confidential employee data was accessed or exposed as part of the incident,\" Peltzman clarified.                                Even if no sensitive customer data was stolen, the market research information to which hackers had access is very valuable in the hands of an economic espionage hacker group, allowing it to determine what technologies are Forrester's customers working on, or what products they're ready to launch. This information could then be resold on dark markets or competitors, or hackers could also use it to select future targets \u2014 companies that are ready to launch valuable products. \"We recognize that hackers will attack attractive targets \u2014 in this case, our research IP. We also understand there is a tradeoff between making it easy for our clients to access our research and security measures,\" said George F. Colony, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Forrester. \"We feel that we have taken a common-sense approach to those two priorities; however, we will continuously look at that balance to respond to changing cybersecurity risk.\" Forrester is the fourth major financial and business entity that suffered or announced a security incident in the past month.

The patch note urged miners to shut down their older versions urgently and replace them with the new version, Bitcoin Core 0.16.3. The announcement, first reported on Hacked, revealed that all the recent Bitcoin Core versions could be vulnerable to Distributed Denial-of-Service attack. An attack of such kind typically involves multiple compromised systems to flood a single system (or network) \u2013 similar to zombies encircling an uninfected person and disabling his movements. DDoS perpetrators could attack a Bitcoin network by either flooding the block with duplicate transactions, thus jamming the transaction confirmation of other people, or by flooding the nodes on Bitcoin\u2019s peer-to-peer network, thus over-utilizing the bandwidth through malicious transaction relays. The recent DDoS vulnerability, termed as CVE-2018-17144, tried to attempt the latter \u2013 flooding full node operators with traffic. Hacked reports:     \u201cThe way the potential exploit could work was by allowing anyone who was capable of mining a sufficient number of proof of work blocks to crash Bitcoin Cores running software versions 0.14.0 to 0.16.2.\u201d It also means that the miners who occasionally run Bitcoin Core were not vulnerable to the attack. Still, developers recommended all the miners to go ahead with the latest update to stay safe. Also, the patch fixed some other minor bugs related to consensus, RPC, invalid flag errors, and documentation. It is worth noticing that Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency that is on the DDoS attackers\u2019 hitlist. Flaws have been found in other cryptocurrency clients as well, including Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum. An effective attack on the Ethereum network lasted more than a month and created million of dead accounts. In response, developers had to go through two on-chain forks and one off-chain process to clean up the mess. In another DDoS attack that slowed down the Ethereum network, miners had to increase gas fees to repel the attackers. There was no consensus failure. DDoS continues to be a global problem that impacts all spheres of the internet.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: replace, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: could be vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: termed as, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were not vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: recommended, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The flaw therefore puts Systemd-powered Linux computers \u2013 specifically those using systemd-networkd \u2013 at risk of remote hijacking: maliciously crafted DHCPv6 packets can try to exploit the programming cockup and arbitrarily change parts of memory in vulnerable systems, leading to potential code execution. This code could install malware, spyware, and other nasties, if successful. The vulnerability \u2013 which was made public this week \u2013 sits within the written-from-scratch DHCPv6 client of the open-source Systemd management suite, which is built into various flavors of Linux. This client is activated automatically if IPv6 support is enabled, and relevant packets arrive for processing. Thus, a rogue DHCPv6 server on a network, or in an ISP, could emit specially crafted router advertisement messages that wake up these clients, exploit the bug, and possibly hijack or crash vulnerable Systemd-powered Linux machines. Here's the Red Hat Linux summary: systemd-networkd is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds heap write in the DHCPv6 client when handling options sent by network adjacent DHCP servers. A attacker could exploit this via malicious DHCP server to corrupt heap memory on client machines, resulting in a denial of service or potential code execution. Felix Wilhelm, of the Google Security team, was credited with discovering the flaw, designated CVE-2018-15688. Wilhelm found that a specially crafted DHCPv6 network packet could trigger \"a very powerful and largely controlled out-of-bounds heap write,\" which could be used by a remote hacker to inject and execute code. \"The overflow can be triggered relatively easy by advertising a DHCPv6 server with a server-id >= 493 characters long,\" Wilhelm noted. In addition to Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Systemd has been adopted as a service manager for Debian, Fedora, CoreOS, Mint, and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. We're told RHEL 7, at least, does not use the vulnerable component by default.

The most concerning of these bugs is an escalation-of-privilege glitch in Intel\u2019s PROset/Wireless Wi-Fi software, which is its wireless connection management tool. The vulnerability, CVE-2018-12177, has a \u201chigh\u201d CVSS score of 7.8, according to Intel\u2019s update. \u201cIntel is releasing software updates to mitigate this potential vulnerability,\u201d it said, urging users to update to version 20.90.0.7 or later of the software. The vulnerability, reported by Thomas Hibbert of Insomnia Security, stems from improper directory permissions plaguing the software\u2019s ZeroConfig service in versions before 20.90.0.7. The issue could allow an authorized user to potentially enable escalation of privilege via local access. The other high-severity bug exists in the company\u2019s System Support Utility for Windows, which offers support for Intel-packed Windows device users. This bug (CVE-2019-0088) is due to insufficient path checking in the support utility, allowing an already-authenticated user to potentially gain escalation of privilege via local access. The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 7.5. Versions of System Support Utility for Windows before 2.5.0.15 are impacted; Intel recommends users update to versions 2.5.0.15 or later. Independent security researcher Alec Blance was credited with discovering the flaw. The chip-maker also patched a high-severity and medium-severity flaw in its Software Guard Extensions (SGX) platform and software, which help application developers to protect select code and data from disclosure or modification. \u201cMultiple potential security vulnerabilities in Intel SGX SDK and Intel SGX Platform Software may allow escalation of privilege or information disclosure,\u201d said Intel.

Ask peripherals maker Logitech, which last week became the latest company to find itself on the receiving end of an embarrassing public flaw disclosure by Google\u2019s Project Zero team. In September, Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy installed Logitech\u2019s Options application for Windows (available separately for Mac), used to customise buttons on the company\u2019s keyboards, mice, and touchpads. Pretty quickly, he noticed some problems with the application\u2019s design, starting with the fact that it\u2026    opens a websocket server on port 10134 that any website can connect to, and has no origin checking at all. Websockets simplify the communication between a client and a server and, unlike HTTP, make it possible for servers to send data to clients without first being asked to, which creates additional security risks.     The only \u201cauthentication\u201d is that you have to provide a pid [process ID] of a process owned by your user, but you get unlimited guesses so you can bruteforce it in microseconds. Ormandy claimed this might offer attackers a way of executing keystroke injection to take control of a Windows PC running the software. Within days of contacting Logitech, Ormandy says he had a meeting to discuss the vulnerability with its engineers on 18 September, who assured him they understood the problem. A new version of Options appeared on 1 October without a fix, although in fairness to Logitech that was probably too soon for any patch for Ormandy\u2019s vulnerability to be included. As anyone who\u2019s followed Google\u2019s Project Zero will know, it operates a strict 90-day deadline for a company to fix vulnerabilities disclosed to it, after which they are made public.     I would recommend disabling Logitech Options until an update is available. Clearly, the disclosure got things moving \u2013 on 13 December, Logitech suddenly updated Options to version 7.00.564 (7.00.554 for Mac). The company also tweeted that the flaws had been fixed, confirmed by Ormandy on the same day. Logitech aren\u2019t the first to feel Project Zero\u2019s guillotine on their neck.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: fixing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: noticed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: claimed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discuss, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: appeared, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be included, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are made public, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: updated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: had been fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The cyber attack on the computer systems of Mahatma Gandhi Mission Hospital came to light on July 15, police said. Hospital administrators found the systems locked, with an encrypted message by unidentified attackers demanding ransom in Bitcoins to unlock it, said Tushar Doshi, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime). Authorities found that access to the data of the previous 15 days had been blocked. Such attacks are described as `ransomware' attacks, where a malicious software enters the victim's computer system, and the attackers threaten to publish the data or block access to it unless a ransom is paid.

The computer system in a Florida Keys school district were down for a week due to a ransomware attack. The problems were made worse when just as the district was bringing up some administration and school computers, Comcast suffered a day-long outage due to a cut fiber. Monroe County School District was the victim of a GandCrab ransomware attack. GandCrab, first spotted in January, was dubbed the leading ransomware threat in July. A school district employee working on payroll discovered undisclosed problems on Sunday, Sept 9, and submitted an IT ticket. IT contacted Symantec and was advised to bring it all down and secure the system. Pat Lefere, executive director of operations and planning for the district, told the Miami Herald, \u201cThis particular one was a variant that Symantec hadn\u2019t seen before. They took all of our files and created a patch for us. It was applied to all servers before bringing them back up.\u201d Symantec shows the latest detected GandCrab ransomware discovered on Wednesday, Sept 12, but it may not be the variant that hit the Florida school district, as the IT department thought it had fixed the problem on Tuesday morning. Yet upon bringing the system back up, they saw the same issues as when the ransomware was discovered on Sunday and shut the system down again. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had any access to data that was inappropriate nor have we had lost data,\u201d district superintendent Mark Porter later told the Miami Herald. \u201cThe bad news is we haven\u2019t had the type of access our employees are used to.\u201d The cyber attack did not affect payroll, but it did affect delivery of students\u2019 mid-quarter progress reports. Monroe County School District claimed there were no ransom demands, but since ransomware locks up a system and demands payment to retrieve a decryption key for encrypted files, perhaps the district meant it didn\u2019t cave to extortion? Lefere said, \u201cThat only happens for folks that don\u2019t back up their stuff and are so desperate.

Fortunately the city\u2019s IT systems were backed up and officials were able to avoid the high ransom demanded by the criminals responsible for the attack. City officials did, however, call in the FBI to investigate the attack and while they were unable to identify anyone directly involved in the attack, they were able to trace the ransom demand to Romania. O\u2019Connor added that the attack appeared to be a more sophisticated ransomware where there are two keys needed to unlock your system with one planted in the system and the other is held by the culprit. The city was insured and ended up having to pay around $5,000 in out of pocket expenses as well as added a firewall security to prevent future attacks.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was hit with a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: asked for, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the high ransom demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: having to pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

For the second time in three years, the school district is the target of a ransomware attack \u2014 a particularly virulent computer malware that spreads from computer to computer, locking up access to network servers and turning documents into gibberish before offering \"help\" in the form of a request for payment to provide a \"key\" to unlock the files. Last time, in March 2016, the district had to cancel school for a day to allow technology staff time to recover from the malware, which infected some of the district's servers and many of its more than 600 computers. This time, it happened over summer vacation, and the attack was not as devastating. According to the staff report from Cloquet School District Technology Director T.J.Smith, the virus encrypted files on all servers except one, including network shared drives. However, there is no indication that any information was \"stolen,\" just that it had been encrypted, so users were unable to open the files. Smith explained to Cloquet School Board members Monday, Aug 13, that the district had two options, not including paying the ransom demand: either try to recover the data, which may not be successful and could be a waste of time and money, or figure out how to recreate the data and rebuild the affected servers. He advocated the second option, noting that the lost data was not \"mission critical\" and that insurance will pay to return the servers to their previous state. Board members voted unanimously for the second option of re-creating information and rebuilding the servers; they also voted to hire a company to do a \"forensic\" investigation to try and determine how the virus got in. The total cost to the school district for insurance deductibles, estimated at $15,000, will be covered by money already in the technology budget. Superintendent Michael Cary said the district determined that paying a ransom \"is not in the best interest of our schools and the community we serve.\" Board Chairman Ted Lammi said he believes such payments to hackers should be illegal. \"Some institutions have paid big bucks and that's why these guys do it,\" Lammi said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a request for payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was \"stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: paying the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Due to attack, employees needed to switch to paper charting and various systems were taken offline immediately. This fairly quick response limited the ransomware damage and prevented the possible data breach.[2] According to Karin Janiszewski, director of marketing and public relations for EORH and OVMC, hospitals reacted as soon as possible and, at the moment of writing, they are already using the computer network. On the following Saturday, Karin Janiszewski stated:     There has been no patient information breach. The hospitals are switching to paper charting to ensure patient data protection. We have redundant security, so the attack was able to get through the first layer but not the second layer. IT staff dealt with the outbreak to avoid a data breach When it comes to malware attacks on large companies, the loss of personal customer data is the worst thing that can happen. It seems that this time the situation was handled quick enough to prevent having the sensitive data being compromised.  IT team took several computers offline, and, because of this, most of the clinical operations transferred to other units, and emergency patients were automatically taken to different locations. On Saturday, when the incidents occurred, hospital officials stated that the staff is ready to take everything on paper until the downtime is over. Also, since this is a ransomware-type malware attack, hackers demand a ransom. However, officials did not select the scenario involving making the payment. No matter how big or how little the ransom demand is, officials shouldn't even consider making the payment because it may lead to system damage or permanent data loss.[3] In the United States, data breaches and malware attacks on huge organizations have become a common thing, especially in the healthcare industry. In 2016 Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital paid the demanded ransom in Bitcoin after having its data encrypted.[4] The infection was widespread and the attack cost around $17 000. Another incident that resulted in ransom payment was spotted in Kansas Heart Hospital in 2016 also.

A federal grand jury in Atlanta returned an indictment Tuesday accusing Faramarz Shahi Savandi and Mohammad Mehdi Shah Mansouri of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, federal prosecutors said in a news release Wednesday. The New Jersey indictment against the pair was filed last month on broad conspiracy charges that included the Atlanta cyberattack. Byung \u201cBJay\u201d Pak, the U.S. attorney in Atlanta, said in a news release that the Atlanta indictment was sought in coordination with the earlier indictment and seeks to ensure that \u201cthose responsible for the attacks face justice here as well.\u201d The Atlanta indictment accuses the two men of launching a ransomware attack against Atlanta that encrypted vital city computer systems. The attack significantly disrupted city operations and caused millions of dollars in losses, prosecutors said. The Department of Justice has said the two men remain fugitives and are believed to be in Iran, though they are not believed to be connected to the Iranian government. No attorney was listed for either man in online court records. In the Atlanta attack, a ransomware known as SamSam was used to infect about 3,789 computers belonging to the city, prosecutors said. The ransomware encrypted the files on the computers and showed a ransom note demanding payment for a decryption key. The note demanded 0.8 bitcoin per affected computer or six bitcoin to decrypt all affected computers. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said in the days after the ransomware attack that the ransom demand was equivalent to $51,000. The ransom note provided a bitcoin address to pay the ransom and a website accessible only on the dark web, where it said the city could retrieve the decryption key, prosecutors said. The decryption key became inaccessible shortly after the attack, and the city didn\u2019t pay the ransom, prosecutors said. The New Jersey indictment filed Nov 27 accuses the two men of creating the SamSam ransomware and says it was used to encrypt the computers of more than 200 victims, including government agencies, cities and businesses.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the Atlanta attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

This is according to Kovelin Naidoo, chief cyber security officer at FNB, who explains that although social media scams in SA are not yet as prevalent as global counterparts; the reality is that they do exist. As social media continues to gain prominence among South African consumers, Naidoo believes platforms like Instagram, Youtube, Facebook and Twitter have also become a platform where fraudsters attempt to catch unsuspecting consumers off guard. \"Given that the popularity of social media is set to remain for the coming years, consumers are encouraged to constantly educate themselves and their loved ones about the latest methods that fraudsters use to get hold of their victims' personal information,\" adds Naidoo. Naidoo warns consumers to look out for money laundering scams - when scammers trick people through social media platforms by claiming to have large sums of cash that they need to deposit urgently through a foreign bank account and identity theft - when fraudsters steal information and use it illegally by impersonating victims. \"Social media blackmail is another scam to watch out for - never share personal photos or videos on social media that portray you in a compromising position as scammers can use these against you by threatening to send them to close family members or upload them on public platforms. Another scam to gain traction is a social media phishing scam, where fraudsters pretend to represent the victim's bank on social media platforms,\" advises Naidoo. Manuel Corregedor, COO of Telspace Systems, says consumers who use social media platforms to meet companions or their life partners should also look out for dating or romance scams. \"In these scams, criminals play on the emotions of victims in order to scam them out of money i.e. they target certain profiles based on age, gender and marital status. Once connected, the criminal starts to 'build a relationship', with the victim as a means to get them to like or love them. Once this happens, the criminal plays on the victim's emotions as a means to get money from the client.\" It is necessary to create an awareness around such scams and educate people, advises Corregedor. However, it should be noted, that these scams are not new - they existed before social media.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: a social media phishing scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: pretend to represent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Cyber criminals use chain letters to distribute malware - a letter may contain a link to a malicious Web site. A recipient is lured into visiting the site on some pretext or other, for example they are warned about a virus epidemic and are offered the possibility to download an 'antivirus program'. \"Furthermore phishing scams via social media messages are also markedly more detailed and sophisticated than the average phishing e-mail.

The IRS puts out strong warnings each year\u2014often republishing its \u201c\u2019Dirty Dozen\u2019 list of tax scams\u201d several times between January and April. This year, phishing schemes\u2014in which scammers send emails pretending to be from the IRS in order to trick people into divulging sensitive information\u2014topped the list. \u201cWe urge taxpayers to watch out for these tricky and dangerous schemes,\u201d acting IRS Commissioner David Kautter said in a March 5 warning to consumers. \u201cPhishing and other scams on the \u2018Dirty Dozen\u2019 list can trap unsuspecting taxpayers. Being cautious and taking basic security steps can help protect people and their sensitive tax and financial data.\u201d Threat researchers at Zscaler published a blog on March 15 outlining four new phishing schemes they identified during this tax season, most of which used fake IRS websites to steal taxpayers\u2019 information. \u201cCybercriminals have long used social engineering and phishing techniques to lure unsuspecting users into giving away private information,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u201cThey track current trends and events to make their attacks more effective, and tax season offers a rich opportunity for attackers to disguise themselves as well-known brands and even government agencies in an effort to exploit users.\u201d This tendency is on display with the \u201cchalbhai\u201d phishing attack, which uses a spoof of an outdated IRS form to trick users into giving up their tax identification information, which can then be used to file false returns. While studying this campaign, researchers noticed the term \u201cchalbhai\u201d used in the source code. \u201cWe have typically seen this tag associated with phishing pages that look like Microsoft Office 365, Apple ID, Dropbox or DocuSign,\u201d Zscaler wrote. \u201cThis is a good example of criminals adapting their phishing content to reflect current trends,\u201d i.e., tax season. Another similar scheme directed users to a fake IRS page for unlocking expired passwords. Researchers noted this campaign was particularly tricky, as users were redirected to a legitimate IRS page after giving up their information.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing schemes, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: send, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: pretending to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: Phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trap, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing schemes, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: disguise themselves as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: look like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were redirected, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Detailed by researchers at Barracuda Networks, the invoice impersonation attacks aim to persuade the victim that the messages are from trusted sources, or to act on impulse -- planting the idea that the target has lost money is a common tactic in phishing emails, as it creates panic for the user. The victim thinks they are reacting to an important request when all they're doing is playing right into the hands of the attackers. A new wave of these attacks involves attackers sending status updates for invoices -- but these don't just involve threat actors firing off millions of messages at random and hoping for the best; they're specially crafting the attacks to look authentic and crucially, from someone the target might trust. In one example of this attack, the target receives an email asking for a reply to a query about the payment status of an invoice. A legitimate-looking invoice number is provided in the subject line and the sender's name is chosen to be someone the recipient knows.  Mimicking someone the victim knows suggests the attackers are already familiar with the target and their network -- this information could simply have been scraped from a public profile such as LinkedIn or it could indicate that the attackers already have a foothold in the network which they're looking to exploit for further gains. The message might look legitimate at first glance -- especially for someone quickly scanning emails in a high-paced financial environment -- but the invitation to click on a link to respond to the supposed status should be treated with suspicion. But if a recipient does click through, the link will download a Word document supposedly containing the invoice -- which then goes onto install malware onto the system. It could be subtle, like a trojan or the victim could recognise their error immediately if faced with ransomware. The attackers aren't just using a single template in the campaign, researchers have spotted other lures used in an effort to distribute a malicious payload. A second invoice impersonation attack uses the subject 'My current address update' and claims to contain information from a trusted contact about a change of address, along with details of a new invoice.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: persuade, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: these attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: crafting the attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: this attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: receives, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: is chosen to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: Mimicking, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claims to contain, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

While emails are a fairly common way of luring victims, it\u2019s not every day that you hear about calls being involved to dupe folks. Ars Technica reports that the attack begins with an email which is designed to look like an official iCloud account warning. It claims a sign-in attempt was blocked on their account since someone tried to use their password. There\u2019s a \u201cCheck Activity\u201d button which opens up a page on a compromised site for a men\u2019s salon in South India. The webpage immediately redirects the victim to another site, followed by another redirection to a fake Apple Support page asking them to contact support since their iPhone has been locked due to illegal activity. If they fall for the bait, the site launches a \u201cscanning\u201d box which eventually gives way to a pop-up box prompting the victim to call a number. If the email is opened in an iPhone, the number can be called straightaway. iPads and Macs can\u2019t do the same, so the system will ask if they want to open it in FaceTime. The publication actually dialed the number and got in touch with someone who described themselves as \u201cLance Roger from Apple Care.\u201d It seems the elaborate scheme is targeting email addresses associated with iCloud. The end game is to trick iPhone users into enrolling in a rogue mobile device management service. This allows the attackers to push infected apps onto the victim\u2019s device, all the while pretending this is a part of Apple\u2019s security service. The phishing site is still live right now, but both Google and Apple have marked it as deceptive. Ars Technica has additionally passed on the technical details of the scam to an Apple security team member. The company told Engadget that it has resources on its support website to help people tell right from wrong. Everyday iOS users could still easily get fooled though.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing scams, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: luring, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: dupe, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: designed to look like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: redirects, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: fall for the bait, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: pretending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

The RCE security issue is being tracked as CVE-2019-0586 and according to Microsoft's advisory it exists because \"the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.\" Attackers can run code as System user Following a successful attack of a vulnerable Microsoft Exchange Server installations, potential attackers would be able to take advantage of System user permissions.     An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the System user. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts. In order to exploit the CVE-2019-0586 vulnerability, attackers have to send maliciously crafter emails to a vulnerable Exchange server. The issue has been addressed by changing the way Microsoft Exchange handles objects in memory. The information disclosure Microsoft Exchange Server vulnerability was assigned the CVE-2019-0588 tracking id and it is caused by the way Microsoft Exchange's \"PowerShell API grants calendar contributors more view permissions than intended.\"     To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to be granted contributor access to an Exchange Calendar by an administrator via PowerShell. The attacker would then be able to view additional details about the calendar that would normally be hidden. The CVE-2019-0588, security vulnerability was fixed by correcting the way Exchange's PowerShell API grants permissions to contributors. Microsoft rated the two vulnerabilities as 'Important' Microsoft assigned an Important severity level to both security issues and, until their public disclosure, no mitigation factors or workarounds have been found. On servers that are using user account control (UAC) the update may fail to install if the update packages are run without Administrator privileges.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being tracked as, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: send, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: has been addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was assigned, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The Adobe January Patch Tuesday updates brought fixes for security vulnerabilities in Adobe Digital Editions and Adobe Connect. It has also released patches for Flash Player, but they are not security fixes. This Tuesday, Adobe has rolled-out scheduled monthly updates for its products. However, this time, it has particularly focused on Adobe Digital Editions and Adobe Connect for security fixes. Besides, the update bundle is relatively smaller, unlike the previous updates that addressed tens of vulnerabilities. According to the security advisory, Adobe has fixed an important security vulnerability in Adobe Digital Editions. Describing the problem, they stated,     \u201cSuccessful exploitation could lead to information disclosure in the context of the current user.\u201d Reportedly, it\u2019s an out of bounds read flaw (CVE-2018-12817) that affected the software version 4.5.9 and earlier for all platforms, i.e., Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS. Users should ensure updating their devices with the patched Adobe Digital Editions version 4.5.10. In addition to the above, another important vulnerability existed in Adobe Connect that could result in session token exposure. As stated in the advisory, the vulnerability (CVE-2018-19718) could \u201clead to exposure of privileges granted to a session.\u201d The vulnerability affected the Adobe Connect versions 9.8.1 and earlier for all platforms. Users should, hence, ensure updating their systems with the patched version 10.1. Besides the two security fixes, Adobe have released patches for Flash Player as well addressing performance issues. As described in the Adobe advisory,     \u201cAdobe has released updates for Adobe Flash Player for Windows, macOS, Linux and Chrome OS.\u202f These updates address feature and performance bugs, and do not include security fixes.\u201d The patched Flash Player version 32.0.0.114 has been rolled-out to be downloaded across all platforms. This time, the update bundle did not address security problems in Adobe Reader or Acrobat. However, the vendors already released security fixes for them in the previous week. The patch addressed two critical vulnerabilities (CVE-2018-16011 and CVE-2018-16018) that could result in arbitrary code execution and privilege escalation respectively.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has  released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has also released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has rolled-out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: updating, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: existed in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: updating, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addressing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been rolled-out to be downloaded, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

These fixes also included a fix for a zero-day vulnerability that was under active exploitation before these patches were made available. Microsoft also announced the re-release of its Windows 10 version 1809 and Windows Server 2019. Microsoft credited Kaspersky Lab researchers for discovering this zero-day, which is also known as CVE-2018-8589 and impacts the Windows Win32k component. A Kaspersky spokesperson told ZDNet, \u201cthey discovered the zero-day being exploited by multiple cyber-espionage groups (APTs).\u201d The zero-day had been used to elevate privileges on 32-bit Windows 7 versions. This is the second Windows elevation of privilege zero-day patched by Microsoft discovered by Kaspersky researchers. Last month, Microsoft patched CVE-2018-8453, another zero-day that had been used by a state-backed cyber-espionage group known as FruityArmor. However, in this month\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Microsoft has not patched a zero-day that is affecting the Windows Data Sharing Service (dssvc.dll). This zero-day was disclosed on Twitter at the end of October. According to ZDNet, \u201cMicrosoft has published this month a security advisory to instruct users on how to properly configure BitLocker when used together with solid-state drives (SSDs).\u201d As reported by Microsoft, the Windows 10 October 2018 update caused user\u2019s data loss post updating. Due to this, the company decided to pause the update. However, yesterday, Microsoft announced that it is re-releasing Windows 10 version 1809. John Cable, the director of Program Management for Windows Servicing and Delivery at Microsoft said, \u201cthe data-destroying bug that triggered that unprecedented decision, as well as other quality issues that emerged during the unscheduled hiatus, have been thoroughly investigated and resolved.\u201d Microsoft also announced the re-release of Windows Server 2019, which was affected by the same issue.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were made available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovering, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: known as, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: impacts, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: being exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: has not patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: is affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Microsoft has rolled out its August Patch Tuesday fixes, addressing 19 critical vulnerabilities, including fixes for two zero-day vulnerabilities that are under active attack. Overall, the company patched a total of 60 flaws, spanning Microsoft Windows, Edge, Internet Explorer (IE), Office, .NET Framework,  ChakraCore, Exchange Server, Microsoft SQL Server and Visual Studio. Of those, 19 were critical, 39 were rated important, one was moderate and one was rated low in severity.  The patch release includes two exploited flaws, CVE-2018-8373 and CVE-2018-8414, which were previously disclosed by researchers. The first zero-day, CVE-2018-8373, could result in remote code-execution (RCE) and grants the same privileges as a logged-in user, including administrative rights. The vulnerability exists in IE 9, 10 and 11, impacting all Windows operating systems from Server 2008 to Windows 10. Meanwhile, CVE-2018-8414 also enables RCE with the privileges of the logged-in user, and exists on Windows 10 versions 1703 and newer, as well as Server 1709 and Server 1803. \u201cThe two zero-day vulnerabilities are \u2026 publicly disclosed and exploited,\u201d said Chris Goettl, director of product management, security, for Ivanti, in an email. \u201cCVE-2018-8373 is a vulnerability that exists in the way that the scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer.

Both incidents appear to have been linked to a third-party reservation platform, SynXis, which only begun informing client hotels of the security breach in June, months after the attacks took place. Hard Rock Hotels & Casinos issued a statement informing customers of the data breach last week, which took place due to the Sabre Hospitality Solutions SynXis third-party reservation system. The hotel chain, which operates 176 cafes, 24 hotels and 11 casinos in 75 countries, said SynXis, the backbone infrastructure for reservations made through hotels and travel agencies, provided the avenue for data theft and the exposure of customer information. \"The unauthorized party first obtained access to payment card and other reservation information on August 10, 2016,\" the hotel chain said. \"The last access to payment card information was on March 9, 2017.\" Hard Rock Hotel & Casino properties in Biloxi, Cancun, Chicago, Goa, Las Vegas, Palm Springs, Panama Megapolis, Punta Cana, Rivera Maya, San Diego and Vallarta are all affected. According to Sabre, an \"unauthorized party gained access to account credentials that permitted unauthorized access to payment card information, as well as certain reservation information\" for a \"subset\" of reservations. The attacker was able to grab unencrypted payment card information for hotel reservations, including cardholder names, card numbers, and expiration dates. In some cases, security codes were also exposed, alongside guest names, email addresses, phone numbers, and addresses. In May, Sabre said an investigation into a possible breach was underway. In a quarterly SEC filing, the company said, \"unauthorized access has been shut off, and there is no evidence of continued unauthorized activity at this time.\" While Sabre has not revealed exactly how the system was breached, the company has hired third-party cybersecurity firm Mandiant to investigate. Loews Hotels also appears to be a victim of the same security failure. According to NBC, Sabre was also at fault and cyberattackers were able to slurp credit card, security code, and password information through the booking portal. In some cases, email addresses, phone numbers, and street addresses were also allegedly exposed.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: the data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data theft, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the exposure, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: obtained access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: The last access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: gained access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: unauthorized access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: grab, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: slurp, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Matthew Maglieri faced more than a challenge when he agreed to become the chief information security officer for Ruby Life Inc., parent of the Toronto-based Ashley Madison and other dating sites which in 2015 saw hackers release records of some 36 million members, plus application code and corporate email. Even Maglieri says the company suffered a \u201ctremendous loss of consumer trust,\u201d and \u201cusers relied on discretion using the service, and that discretion was violated.\u201d When he tried recruiting security staff this year a number balked when hearing who their employer would be. In fact, he admitted Wednesday at the monthly meeting of the Toronto Area Security Klatch (TASK), a group of infosec pros and students, that a headhunter he consulted flatly told him to decline the offer. \u201cAbsolutely not, your personal brand is at stake,\u201d he recalled being told. And that\u2019s why he said yes. \u201cI thought about it \u2018If I don\u2019t do this there isn\u2019t going to be anybody fighting for the users,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to dive in and take on the challenge.\u201d Now the company is recovering, Maglieri says, because it is signing up 550,000 users a month.

Details about Tesla cloud account breach where included in RedLock report as an example of the cyber-security threats face enterprises that store sensitive data and run important business applications on cloud services.  RedLock\u2019s Cloud Security Intelligence team found that the Tesla breach resulted from the exposure of Amazon Web Services security credentials after hackers penetrated Tesla\u2019s Kubernetes console, which was not password protected This led to the exposure of the company\u2019s Amazon S3 cloud account, which contained sensitive data including the Tesla vehicle telemetry.   What was most remarkable about the CSI report was that the problems that affect on premises infrastructure are the same ones that affect cloud infrastructure. The difference is that most organizations have learned over the years to provide at least some level of protection for their on premises infrastructure and assets. Unfortunately, it appears that the same isn\u2019t true of their cloud resources.  Part of the problem, it appears, comes from a lack of familiarity with managing cloud services. But security for those services does exist is readily available. Amazon, for example regularly sends out emails to AWS users explaining what security measures, products and services are available for its cloud environments.  Unlike private, on-premises environments, the public cloud is just that\u2014public. That means it can be accessed by anyone, including an attacker that possesses the credentials that can enable access from anywhere. What that means is that access security is even more important, because you have no means of preventing a criminal from trying to gain access.  But it also means that monitoring your cloud environment is just as important as your on premises physical environment. Monitoring at least provides a way to find an attacker that\u2019s gotten past your access controls. The CSI team also recommends a \u201cdeny all\u201d setting on your firewall for outbound cloud traffic, and setting your cloud so that configuration changes are automatically reported.  The key here is to remember that while the cloud provider can play a role in helping ensure your cloud is secure, they can\u2019t do it alone.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: cloud account breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the exposure, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: penetrated, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the exposure, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

A total of 28 case settlements for the use of unlicensed software occurred in 2017 \u2013 twice the amount in 2016. The 28 settlements were worth more than $347,000 in damages against businesses across Australia. BSA warns that with the Notifiable Data Breaches legislation now in effect, this is a good time for organisations to consider the risks unlicensed software bring to their business. \u201cBusinesses need to remember that unlicensed software, or software downloaded from an unknown source, may contain malware which puts an organisation and its customers at significant risk of becoming the victim of a data breach,\u201d comments BSA APAC\u2019s director of compliance programs, Gary Gan. \u201cWithout properly licensed software, organisations don\u2019t receive patch updates which strengthen the software\u2019s security and address vulnerabilities, which otherwise would leave the business exposed.\u201d One of the 28 settlements involved a Western Australia-based energy company that was found using unlicensed software. The settlement amounted to more than $40,000. Every business caught using unlicensed software had to purchase genuine software licenses for ongoing use on top of the copyright infringement damages.  \u201cIt\u2019s especially important that organisations are ensuring they\u2019re doing all they can to protect their data given the recent introduction of NDB legislation. In order to stay on top of their software licensing, businesses should consider investing in SAM tools. The potential consequences faced by businesses that are found to be using unlicensed software far outweighs the cost of investment into SAM, something that all businesses should be considering,\u201d Gan continues. The BSA continues to clamp down on unlawful use of its members\u2019 software. Members include Adobe, Apple, IBM, Microsoft, Okta, Oracle, Symantec, Trend Micro and Workday, amongst others. BSA offers up to $20,000 to eligible recipients who disclose accurate information regarding unlawful copying or use of BSA members\u2019 software.

Whether it\u2019s selling W2 forms online or sending malicious emails that look like they are from the IRS, cybercriminals tend to keep themselves busy this time of year. Rick Holland, VP of strategy at Digital Shadows, joined this week\u2019s Hacker Tracker to highlight how cybercriminals are utilizing the dark web to support their tax fraud campaigns. Earlier this year, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported that there was a reduction in the number of fraudulent tax returns identified between 2013 and 2015. On the other hand, around that same time the IRS released data showing that phishing and malware incidents in the 2016 tax season increased by 400 percent. Noting that the number of identified fraudulent returns was not indicative of the overall levels of tax fraud occurring, Digital Shadows set out to reconcile two very different perspectives on the same problem. In response, the external digital risk management team recently released its research assessing dark web and criminal chatter related to tax fraud so far this year. As of February, the number of mentions in 2017 so far was already over 40 percent of the 2016 total. Rick Holland, VP of strategy at Digital Shadows, explained that cybercriminals are often using the dark web marketplaces to sell W2s for as little as $4, which include a victim\u2019s full information that can then be used for whatever campaign the cybercriminal is going to run. In fact, he noted that often cybercriminals capitalize on phishing and malware schemes during this time by using the term \u201ctax refund\u201d in an email subject of a message that looks like it\u2019s from the IRS. However, those malicious emails are actually just delivering malware to a computer for other purposes, maybe to participate in a botnet or something similar. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s easy to think of the personal fraud that\u2019s being committed, and certainly that is happening, but I think it\u2019s important to remember that it goes much broader as far as what the adversaries are doing,\u201d Holland said. At the end of the day, fraudsters are doing everything they can increase the likelihood of their social engineering being successful.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: selling, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: look like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sell, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: looks like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Security researchers found that the gigabytes of files were accessible to anyone because the internet-connected backup drive was not password protected. The files, reviewed by ZDNet, contained a range of personal information, such as names and addresses, ranks, and Social Security numbers of more than 4,000 officers. Another file lists the security clearance levels of hundreds of other officers, some of whom possess \"top secret\" clearance, and access to sensitive compartmented information and codeword-level clearance. Phone numbers and contact information of staff and their spouses, as well as other sensitive and private personal information, were found in several other spreadsheets. The drive is understood to belong to a lieutenant colonel, whose name we are not publishing. ZDNet reached out to the officer by email but did not hear back. The data was secured last week after a notification by MacKeeper security researcher Bob Diachenko. Among the most damaging documents on the drive included the completed applications for renewed national security clearances for two US four-star generals, both of whom recently had top US military and NATO positions. Both of these so-called SF86 applications contain highly sensitive and detailed information, including financial and mental health history, past convictions, relationships with foreign nationals, and other personal information. These completed questionnaires are used to determine a candidate's eligibility to receive classified material. Several national security experts and former government officials we spoke to for this story described this information as the \"holy grail\" for foreign adversaries and spies, and said that it should not be made public. For that reason, we are not publishing the names of the generals, who have since retired from service. Nevertheless, numerous attempts to contact the generals over the past week went unreturned. \"Some of the questions ask for information that can be very personal, as well as embarrassing,\" said Mark Zaid, a national security attorney, in an email.

If exploited, these vulnerabilities would allow an attacker, whether inside or outside the organization, to take full control of the SAP HANA platform remotely, without the need of a username and password. \u201cThis level of access would allow an attacker to perform any action over the business information and processes supported by HANA, including creating, stealing, altering, and/or deleting sensitive information. If these vulnerabilities are exploited, organizations may face severe business consequences,\u201d said Sebastian Bortnik, Head of Research, Onapsis. The vulnerabilities affect a specific SAP HANA component named SAP HANA User Self Service, which is not enabled by default. The following list details the affected HANA 2 and HANA versions: \u201cWe hope organizations will use this threat intelligence to assess their systems and confirm that they are not currently using this component, and therefore are not affected by these risks. Even if the service is not enabled, we still recommend that these organizations apply the patches in case a change is made to the system in the future,\u201d continued Bortnik. Onapsis Research Labs originally discovered the vulnerabilities on the newly released SAP HANA 2 platform, but after additional analysis realized that several older versions were vulnerable as well. Based on this assessment, it was identified that the vulnerabilities had been present in HANA for almost two and a half years, when the User Self Service component was first released. This greatly increases the likelihood that these vulnerabilities have been discovered by attackers to break into organization\u2019s SAP systems. Onapsis worked closely with SAP\u2019s Product Security & Engineering teams to help them develop the security patches. SAP is releasing the first ever patch for SAP HANA 2.

Researchers said last week they came across a malicious function snuck into one of the platform\u2019s modules in order to steal credit card information. Code for the function was injected into a .php file for SF9 Realex, a module that helps sites store customer credit card data for the one-click checkout functionality commonly\u00a0used by repeat customers. The module interacts\u00a0with the Realex RealAuth Remote and Redirect systems, \u201cvery popular solutions in the Magento community,\u201d according to\u00a0Bruno Zanelato, a researcher with the firm Sucuri, who found the malicious function. The function, sendCCNumber(), reroutes credit card information entered by a customer from Magento to an attacker\u2019s email address, hidden inside a variable later in the code. The data, encoded in JSON, arrives in the attacker\u2019s inbox without the victim being any the wiser. According to researchers, the attacker uses binlist.net, a public web service for searching issuer identification numbers (IIN), to help identify which bank each card is associated with. Zanelato said Friday that attackers are going greater lengths to target credit card data, especially in e-commerce platforms like Magento. \u201cMagento credit card stealers are indeed on the rise,\u201d Zanelato wrote Friday, \u201cWhile the information here is specific to Magento, realize that this can affect any platform that is used for ecommerce.

Research has revealed that about 35% of the leaked LinkedIn passwords were already known from previous password dictionaries, making them vulnerable to other accounts. Researchers at behavioral firewall company Preempt took a look at the LinkedIn credentials and also found that 65% of the leaked passwords can be easily cracked with brute force using standard off-the-shelf cracking hardware. The study also looked at general password intelligence and found that password rules, which many enterprises employ, can allow users to create weak passwords that can easily be cracked\u2014and many individuals use the same password for multiple accounts, signaling a password epidemic amongst organizations and their users. \u201cOne thing is certain, any person that used the same password for Linkedin as they did for their work account (or other account), is currently vulnerable within these other accounts,\u201d said Preempt researcher Eran Cohen, in a blog. \u201cUnfortunately, there are many users that don\u2019t make that connection. Their LinkedIn account was breached, so they just change their LinkedIn password, not realizing that if they are using that same password elsewhere, they are actually exposed in all of those places as well. For IT security teams, this is an unknown vulnerability they have to deal with.\u201d Overall, the examination showed that low-complexity passwords can be cracked in less than a day, medium-complexity passwords are cracked in less than a week and high-complexity password are cracked in less than a month. \u201cUsers reuse passwords. They rotate them. Add a digit to them. And even use identical or share passwords with others,\u201d said Cohen. \u201cAs data scientists, it is our job to go deeper, and identify the common human behavior. For example, we\u2019ve seen how local culture impacts passwords, where local football team names are commonly used as passwords. The problem is that only about 1% of people care and are aware that passwords are based on patterns and these patterns can be tracked or broken.\u201d[/INST]\n\nTrigger: dumps, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was breached, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

While seven of the 13 apps obviously focused on Turkish-speaking users, the rest targeted users from across the world. Stefanko says he reported all 13 apps to Google's security team, who removed them from the Play Store last week. The modus operandi of all these apps was the same. The app would then collect the user's login details, send them to a remote server, and show a login error. The error would appear every time the user tried to authenticate, and after a certain number of login attempts, the error would change, and ask the user to visit the official Instagram site instead and authorize the app from there. When the user visited the Instagram homepage, he would see a notification from Instagram letting him know that someone has accessed his account. From this point on, if victims don't change their passwords, the crook would use the victim's Instagram account to like images or follow other accounts. Stefanko believes these apps power online services that offer Instagram likes and followers for money. Back in January, the researcher discovered a similar app that stole Instagram credentials and targeted Turkish users. That app, as well, was hosted on the official Google Play Store. Other ways in which hackers could use the stolen Instagram credentials is to post image ads on people's profiles and to extort some kind of payment from the owners of accounts with a large follower base. Overall, there have been many cases of apps that stole Instagram credentials in the past few years. In November 2015, Apple removed an app named \"Who Viewed Your Profile - InstaAgent\" from the App Store because of the same behavior. Six months later, Google faced a similar incident and was forced to remove two apps named \"Who Viewed Me on Instagram\" and \"InstaCare - Who cares with me?,\" also caught stealing Instagram credentials[/INST]\n\nTrigger: collect, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stole, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stole, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stealing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

These apps, as stated by ESET, target Instagram users who are wanting to either manage or boost the number of followers. Under the detection name Android/Spy.Inazigram these 13 applications were phishing for Instagram credentials and stealing them to a remote server. ESET claims that these apps seem to have originated from Turkey, some apps used English localization to target Instagram users worldwide and have been installed by 1.5 million users. Post notification by the company the apps were removed from the Google Play Store. To lure users into downloading, the apps promised a rapid increase in the number of followers, likes and comments for an Instagram account. The credentials entered into the form were then sent to the attackers\u2019 server in plain text. The compromised accounts were used to raise follower counts of other users. ESET believes that apart from an opportunity to use compromised accounts for spreading spam and ads, there are various business models in which the most valuable assets are followers, likes and comments. All the applications employed the same technique of harvesting Instagram credentials and sending them to a remote server. Interestingly, the Instagram account might appear to have increased following and follower numbers, but the user would be getting replies to comments which have never posted. If the attackers were successful and the user did not recognize the threat upon seeing Instagram\u2019s notification, the stolen credentials could be put to further use. The company suggests that users should uninstall the apps from the application manager or use a reliable mobile security solution to remove the threats. Change the Instagram password and if the password is same for other platforms it should be changed as well, as malware authors are known to access other web services using the stolen credentials. When downloading third party applications from Google Play Store, ESET states that users should not use sensitive information and check if the apps can be trusted by checking the popularity of the developer through the number of installs, content of its reviews and ratings.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: were phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: harvesting, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Before I discuss the details of the latest two SAP HANA vulnerabilities and the potential business impact, let me take a moment to reiterate that this is the most vulnerable period for any SAP customer with this critical flaw in their IT landscape. This period, which I call \u201cHackers Busy Cracking,\u201d started this morning and will not end until affected clients across the globe apply the patch from SAP. Onapsis Security Research Lab discovered these vulnerabilities but hasn\u2019t published technical details yet. We do know that the vulnerability is in the user self-service functionality provided by SAP HANA and has been present since SPS09 of SAP HANA, which was released in 2014. As the name suggests, the user self-service functionality enables users to perform maintenance and support activities for their accounts and for new users to register the accounts. For this functionality to be useful, it must be accessible from wherever the user population is, be it on internal or external networks. The second critical vulnerability revolves around session fixation, which can allow an attacker to elevate privileges by impersonating another user in the system. The SAP HANA 2.0 SPS 00 version is affected by this vulnerability. User self-service is a good example of technology that is a double-edged sword. It cuts costs associated with supporting a large user population and reduces the time taken to correct user issues, thus ensuring individuals spend more time as productive users. However, any unattended mechanism that allows modification of accounts without human intervention will always be an attractive target. According to the Onapsis report, a combination of vulnerabilities can allow an attacker with remote access to the user self-service functionality to edit any account on the system, including activating previously deactivated accounts. The natural target for this attack would be the SYSTEM account present in all HANA deployments. The potential business impact of an attacker with access to the SYSTEM account is extraordinary. I strongly urge all SAP HANA customers to check their HANA version levels and make immediate plans to prioritize these updates. SAP customers who have already deployed active threat protection (ATP) controls or third-party products are one step ahead of zero-day threats.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: being released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discuss, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reiterate, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: apply, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: do know, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been present, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revolves around, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is affected by, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the Onapsis report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers could completely take over user accounts, and access victims\u2019 personal and group conversations, photos, videos and other shared files, contact lists, and more. The vulnerability allows an attacker to send the victim malicious code, hidden within an innocent looking image. As soon as the user clicks on the image, the attacker can gain full access to the victim\u2019s WhatsApp or Telegram storage data, thus giving full access to the victim\u2019s account. The attacker can then send the malicious file to all the victim\u2019s contacts, potentially enabling a widespread attack. Check Point disclosed this information to the WhatsApp and Telegram security teams on March 8, 2017. WhatsApp and Telegram acknowledged the security issue and developed fixes for worldwide web clients. \u201cThankfully, WhatsApp and Telegram responded quickly and responsibly to deploy the mitigation against exploitation of this issue in all web clients,\u201d said Oded Vanunu, head of product vulnerability research at Check Point. WhatsApp Web users wishing to ensure that they are using the latest version are advised to restart their browser. WhatsApp and Telegram use end-to-end message encryption as a data security measure, to ensure that only the people communicating can read the messages, and nobody in between. Yet, the same end-to-end encryption was also the source of this vulnerability. Since messages were encrypted on the side of the sender, WhatsApp and Telegram were blind to the content, and were therefore unable to prevent malicious content from being sent. After fixing this vulnerability, content will now be validated before the encryption, allowing malicious files to be blocked. Both web versions mirror all messages sent and received by the user on the mobile app, and are fully synced with users\u2019 devices[/INST]\n\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: gain full access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: acknowledged, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: developed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: responded quickly, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The flaw in the Struts 2 framework is trivial to exploit: just upload a file with an invalid Content-Type value. It then throws an exception, and opens the target to remote code execution. Shortly after the Struts 2 vulnerability was discovered and documented last week, researchers at Cisco's Talos said they'd observed it under \u201cactive attack\u201d. The Canada Revenue Agency held a press conference in Ottawa Monday afternoon, and confirmed Struts 2 was the reason it took down its services over the weekend. Shared Service Canada COO John Glowacki said while forensic work is continuing, analysis of system logs so far shows nobody \u201cgot inside\u201d CRA's systems. \u201cWe will not speak for other countries, but we will say we have information that some other countries are having greater problems with this specific vulnerability,\u201d he added. Expect vendors to start issuing their own advisories about Struts 2. Cisco has posted its first product advisory, and so far there's more \"confirmed not vulnerable\" than vulnerable products.

Many of those working for the victimized firms have had a stressful time dealing with the fallout. Those who have experienced this unique type of crime say it's a nightmare. Some of those affected have had fraudulent returns filed under their name, in addition to issues with educational expenses. In one case, the scammers created flexible spending accounts with their stolen identities. The Phishing attacks causing so much damage, also known as BEC (Business Email Compromise) attacks, are simple and effective. They exploit trust relationships within the office, and in many cases, exploit the routine practice of sharing data via email. According to the IRS, these attacks are some of the most dangerous email scams the agency has seen in a long time. \"It can result in the large-scale theft of sensitive data that criminals can use to commit various crimes, including filing fraudulent tax returns. We need everyone\u2019s help to turn the tide against this scheme,\" IRS Commissioner, John Koskinen, remarked in a warning issued last month. In 2016, Databreaches.net tracked 145 BEC victims. With more than five weeks left in the current tax season, the count sits at 110 (as of 03-13-17) and shows no signs of slowing.

According to independent researcher Troy Hunt, the database is about 52 gigabytes in size and contains just under 33.7 million unique email addresses and other contact information from employees of thousands of large enterprises and government entities. While details are unfolding, the leak is thought to be from a database D&B acquired from NetProspex in 2015. The file is a \u201clist rental\u201d file that D&B offers marketers for use for their own email campaigns. It\u2019s believed that one of these marketing firms is the source of the leak itself having been compromised in some way. \"We've carefully evaluated the information that was shared with us and it is of a type and in a format that we deliver to customers every day,\u201d D&B said in a media statement. \u201cDun & Bradstreet maintains that neither they or NetProspex suffered a breach or caused the leak,\u201d said Stephen Boyer, co-founder and CTO of third-party risk management and security ratings firm BitSight. \u201cIf true and the leak stemmed from one of their customers, which represents a new dimension of third-party risk. While customers don't have ongoing relationships in the way that vendors and suppliers do, they still can pose risk when licensing and buying data in bulk.\u201d As originally reported by ZDNet, Hunt said in a blog post that he was able to determine that the most records in the database come from the US Department of Defense, with other government and large enterprises following. The worrisome part is the deep bench of information that the records contain. For Wells Fargo, for example, the information is for the C-suite and 45 vice presidents, senior vice presidents, assistant vice presidents and executive vice presidents, all with names and email addresses alongside job titles. \"The market for stolen personal identifiable information continues to be lucrative for attackers to steal and sell data,\u201d said Lee Weiner, chief product officer at Rapid7, via email. \u201cIndividuals affected by this breach should continue to be vigilant for piggy-back attacks that can ensue from attackers using this information to engage in phishing tactics with this information to steal passwords and gain access to accounts.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have been leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: leak, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: leak, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: having been compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: leak, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: leak, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: steal and sell, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: this breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: gain access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

According to Troy Hunt, who received a copy of the compromised MongoDB database, 2,326,452 full names, 2,247,314 unique email addresses, and 287,502 cellphone numbers were included. Most importantly, the great majority of Wishbone users are teenagers and young adults, and predominantly female. \u201cI\u2019d be worried about the potential for kids to abuse the data,\u201d Hunt told Motherboard. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of young people in there and finding, say, young females and being able to contact them by phone is a worry\u201d. Not only that, but the data could be used to ferret out additional information about these persons, either via phishing or by searching the Internet for unsecured social media accounts that can be tied to them. Armed with all this information, fraudsters could easily perpetrate identity theft schemes. And perhaps the stolen data has already been misused.

Karim Baratov, the 22-year-old Canadian hacker who the FBI alleges Russia's state security agency hired to carry out the Yahoo breach, didn't care much for a low profile. His Facebook and Instagram posts boasted of the million-dollar house he bought in a Toronto suburb and there were numerous pictures of him with expensive sports cars -- the latest an Aston Martin DB9 with the license plate \"MR KARIM.\" But forget those for a moment and consider he wasn't very careful in hiding his hacking work. In the domain name records, he listed his home address. \u201cWhen you bring in amateurs who don\u2019t follow standard protocol, that carries risk,\u201d\u00a0said Alex Holden, chief information security officer at Hold Security. At the time, the company notified the FBI but only believed 26 accounts had been targeted. It wasn't until mid 2016 that the true enormity of the hack started to become apparent. Security experts say it\u2019s possible Baratov or a second hacker hired to help might have bragged online about the hack at some point, tipping off U.S. investigators. And then\u00a0in August 2016 a database allegedly stolen from Yahoo was found\u00a0circulating\u00a0on the black market. \u201cSome of the information about this hack was basically leaked,\u201d Holden said. \u201cThat\u2019s not a sign of a mature intelligence operation\u201d. So why did Russia turn to a 22-year-old from Canada? According to the indictment, Baratov broke into the accounts through\u00a0spear phishing\u00a0email attacks, which are often designed to dupe victims into handing over password information. However, spear phishing only works best if the emails appear authentic. \u201cThe benefit of having Karim, the Canadian, on the team probably allowed creation of far more believable phishing attacks due to his being a native English speaker,\u201d said Chester Wisniewski, a research scientist at security firm Sophos, in an email.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: allegedly stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: circulating, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: hack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: spear phishing\u00a0email attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: dupe, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: spear phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

The Israeli multinational said it was concerned about vulnerabilities in the messaging apps, following WikiLeaks\u2019 \u2018Vault 7\u2019 release of more than 8,500 CIA documents. \u201cOne of the most concerning revelations arising from the recent WikiLeaks publication is the possibility that government organizations can compromise WhatsApp, Telegram and other end-to-end encrypted chat applications,\u201d the company said in a blog post. These online versions mirror all messages sent and received by a user\u2019s mobile device, which deploys end-to-end encryption so that only those sending and receiving messages can view the content. Hackers could gain access to a user\u2019s account, however, by booby-trapping a digital image with malicious code which would be activated once the image is viewed. The code could then spread like a virus by sending infected messages to a user's contacts. \u201cThis means that attackers could potentially download your photos and or post them online, send messages on your behalf, demand ransom, and even take over your friends\u2019 accounts,\u201d they added. Check Point said it alerted both companies to the problem last week and waited for the issues to be resolved before making it public. Both companies have said they\u2019ve since patched the problem. \u201cThankfully, WhatsApp and Telegram responded quickly and responsibly to deploy the mitigation against exploitation of this issue in all web clients,\u201d Check Point Head of Product Vulnerability Oded Vanunu said.

The flaw is present in the Cisco Cluster Management Protocol (CMP) processing code in Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software. \u201cThe vulnerability is due to the combination of two factors: the failure to restrict the use of CMP-specific Telnet options only to internal, local communications between cluster members and instead accept and process such options over any Telnet connection to an affected device, and the incorrect processing of malformed CMP-specific Telnet options,\u201d Cisco explained. An exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and obtain full control of the device or cause a reload of the affected device\u201d.

Cisco says that they are not aware of any public announcements or active malicious use of the vulnerability, and that they will provide free software updates to address it (they don\u2019t say when). In the meantime, users can mitigate the risk by disabling the Telnet protocol and switching to using SSH.

ESET\u2019s Trends 2017: Security held ransom presents key cyber security topics of relevance for both businesses and consumers about the latest threats taking shape in the new year and identifies ransomware as a key threat to protect against. The report suggests ransomware will continue en masse. \u201cWe anticipate a new trend on the horizon: The Ransomware of Things or RoT, i.e. the possibility of cybercriminals \u201chijacking\u201d devices such as home security cameras and then demanding a ransom payment in exchange for restoring control to the user,\u201d ESET says in the report. Nick FitzGerald, senior research fellow at ESET agrees that ransomware attacks will continue to increase in ANZ throughout 2017. \u201cRansomware was a serious security problem throughout 2016.

As Motherboard reports, the hackers \u2013 who are calling themselves the \u201cTurkish Crime Family\u201d \u2013 are demanding Apple pay a ransom of $75,000 (in either the Bitcoin or Ethereum cryptocurrencies), or hand over $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards. Motherboard\u2018s Joseph Cox reports that one of the hackers shared screenshots of emails that had allegedly been exchanged with Apple, including one where a member of Apple\u2019s security team asked if the group would be willing to share a sample of the stolen data. If emails shared by the hackers are legitimate, then it appears that Apple\u2019s security team also requested that a YouTube video be removed of an unnamed member of the gang using stolen credentials to access an elderly woman\u2019s iCloud account and view photos that had previously been backed up online. The alleged emails from Apple go on to underline that the technology firm will \u201cnot reward cyber criminals for breaking the law\u201d. What we don\u2019t know is whether the email exchanges between the hackers and Apple are real or faked, and \u2013 indeed \u2013 whether the so-called \u201cTurkish Crime Gang\u201d really has access to a large number of Apple users\u2019 credentials. Other than the video of the elderly woman\u2019s iCloud account being broken into, there has been no evidence shared with the media to suggest that the hackers\u2019 claims of having gained access to a large database of Apple usernames and passwords are legitimate. However, if it\u2019s true that the hackers are attempting to engage with the media in an attempt to increase their chances of a substantial payout then that would be in line with an increasingly common technique deployed by extortionists. For instance, we have discussed before how an individual hacker or hacking group known as The Dark Overlord has targeted investment banks \u2013 stealing internal documents and bringing them to the public\u2019s attention in an attempt to extort more money.

They stole millions of username and password combinations from online services of all shapes and sizes. Blogs and discussion forums were hit particularly hard. Exploiting credentials is an old attack vector that still works wonders for hackers. In its 2016 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR), Verizon added a section about credentials, revealing that 63% of data breaches involved weak, default or stolen passwords. \u201cThis statistic drives our recommendation that this is a bar worth raising,\u201d reads the report. Why is it so easy for cybercriminals to plunder login credentials? End users, despite constant warnings, continue re-using passwords, allowing hackers to conveniently break into multiple accounts after stealing someone's credentials once. It's like having one key for your bike lock, front door, office building, car and bank box. Meanwhile, more software vendors should provide advanced hashing, salting and other scrambling technologies for protecting credential information in case it's stolen. For example, attackers hacked Clash of Kings' forum after exploiting a known vulnerability in an outdated version of the vBulletin software. The thieves stole personal information from 1.6 million user accounts, including scrambled passwords. In one case, an attacker used misplaced install files to gain admin privileges. In another case, hackers stole one moderator's credentials and used the account to post a malicious message in the forum. After viewing the message, the forum's administrator had his account compromised, leading to a massive breach.

The vulnerabilities are present in the latest firmware version running on the devices (v5.2.1). They were discovered by researcher Jason Doyle last fall, and their existence responsibly disclosed to Google, but have still not been patched. The first two flaws can be triggered and lead to a buffer overflow condition if the attacker sends to the camera a too-long Wi-Fi SSID parameter or a long encrypted password parameter, respectively. That\u2019s easy to do as Bluetooth is never disabled after the initial setup of the cameras, and attackers (e.g. burglars) can usually come close enough to them to perform the attack. Triggering one of these flaws will make the devices crash and reboot. The third flaw is a bit more serious, as it allows the attacker to force the camera to temporarily disconnect from the wireless network to which it is connected by supplying it a new SSID to connect to. If that particular SSID does not exist, the camera drops its attempt to associate with it and return to the original Wi-Fi network, but the whole process can last from 60 to 90 seconds, during which the camera won\u2019t be recording. Unfortunately, Bluetooth can\u2019t be disabled on these cameras, so there is little users can do to minimize this particular risk.

The caller claims to be a TalkTalk engineer and to have detected a router or malware issue on the user\u2019s computer that requires immediate intervention. The customer is persuaded to turn on their computer and run the Windows Event Viewer to perform bogus diagnostics before being asked to install one of a range of remote desktop support tools. This type of application gives the scammers complete remote control over the victim\u2019s PC, at which point they are free to steal data, install malware and, in some cases, engineer the user into logging into online banking or transferring money. A popular choice with the fraudsters since at least 2015 has been TeamViewer, so much so that on March 8, TalkTalk abruptly started blocking the application from functioning on its network in a desperate effort to stem a tide of abuse customers had started complaining about. TeamViewer\u2019s block was removed on Thursday after complaints by the company, but that didn\u2019t stop TalkTalk \u00a0from quietly blocking equivalents such as AnyDesk, whose users started noticing unexpected connection issues around the same time. Tech support fraud, or \u201cvishing\u201d,\u00a0has been around for years, so is there much new to be worried about here? The unsettling aspect of the TalkTalk attacks is that the fraudsters allegedly accessed stolen data, which means they immediately sounded more convincing to their victims. If confirmed, this means that fraudsters have been able to synthesise old-fashioned tech support social engineering with data breach cybercrime to create something novel and perhaps unstoppable.

Vermont Governor, Peter Shumlin issued a statement accusing Vladimir Putin of attempting to hack Vermont\u2019s electrical grid, and many others follow suit. And there appears to be a good chance that the malicious code found on a Burlington Electric laptop is evidence of a state sponsored cyberattack. Following the initial news cycle, some pundits dismissed the finding as a non-story. It\u2019s true, the laptop was \u201cnot connected to the power grid systems\u201d, and there is no proof yet that the Russians were involved. It\u2019s also true that the Russian built Grizzly Steppe hacking code is widely available on the dark internet, and anyone could have put it on that laptop. According to Ukrainian energy provider Ukrenergo, a second major outage on December 17, 2016, may have been caused by a similar cyber-attack. Attacks on critical infrastructure typically require a long, slow, low-profile campaign, beginning with subtle, difficult to detect maneuvers, like slipping malware on laptop computers. Two years prior to the first Ukraine incident, hackers began attempting to acquire legitimate login credentials by hacking non-operational systems at Ukrainian utilities \u2013 systems very much like Burlington Electric\u2019s laptop. According to a Booz Allen analysis, spear-phishing emails containing weaponized Microsoft Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files, exactly the type of files typically found on laptop computers, were sent to Ukraine electric utility employees as early as May 2014. Once legitimate login credentials were discovered through these seemingly minor attacks on non-operational systems, the hackers used them to access critical Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in order to shutoff breakers, shutdown uninterrupted power supplies (UPS), destroy Human Machine Interface (HMI) systems, and destroy Serial-to-Ethernet devices at substations.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: acquire, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: hacking, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were sent to, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Real-time threat intelligence provider Recorded Future arrived at those findings by analyzing thousands of sources including information security blogs and deep web forum postings. Recorded Future then ranked each vulnerability based upon how many web references linked the bug to at least one of 141 exploit kits, malicious software packages like Neutrino and RIG which abuse security flaws to infect users with TrickBot and other malware. Recorded Future found the most references to CVE-2016-0189, a vulnerability affecting Internet Explorer. More than 700 web sources linked the bug to the Magnitude, RIG, Neutrino, and Sundown exploit kits. But when it came to actual links with exploit kits, Adobe Flash Player cleaned house. In total, six Adobe Flash Player vulnerabilities appeared in the top 10 list. Two of those (CVE-2016-1o1o and CVE-2015-8446) bonded with the late Angler exploit kit. Another three (CVE-2016-1019, CVE-2016-4117, and CVE-2015-8651) connected to at least three exploit kits. Overall, the regrettable honor of integration with the most exploit kits goes to CVE-2015-7645, a flaw which a mere 70 web sources linked to seven different packages: Neutrino, Angler, Magnitude, RIG, Nuclear Pack, Spartan, and Hunter. Recorded Future provides some background on why this vulnerability likely received so many linkages: \"CVE-2015-7645 impacts Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems, which makes it extremely versatile. Per Adobe, it can be used to take control of the affected system. Additionally, it was the first zero-day exploit discovered after Adobe introduced new security mitigations, and as such, it was quickly adopted as many other older exploits ceased working on machines with newer Flash versions.

The microelectromechanical systems - or MEMS accelerometers - that the research team found to contain these vulnerabilities - are sensors used in various devices to measure acceleration or velocity, and then report those readings to a microprocessor. \"What we looked at was the ability to trick these sensors into delivering false readings to the microprocessor by using sound waves,\" he says in an interview with Information Security Media Group. \"What medical devices contain these sensors is still an open question. The main hazard of this sound wave vulnerability is the threat to the integrity and availability of the sensor, he explains. Prior studies by other researchers had found that sound waves can be used to disable these sensors. \"What's new here is that it is now known that one can actually damage the integrity of the reading,\" he says. \"If you were trusting this reading to do something automated, such as rate-adapt a pacemaker, perhaps based on changing activity of a patient, you now need a second way to verify the integrity of that reading.\" The study lists 20 accelerometers for which the researchers were able to change the output of the sensors using sound waves, Fu says. \"In some devices, we found that there is a speaker built in right next to the sensor, which means there is a remote ability to cause these changes without an adversary being near the chip.\" Fu recommends that manufacturers assess the researchers' list of accelerometers that contain the sound wave vulnerability \"and ask [suppliers] for specific parameters, including the resident frequencies, to understand the risks and mitigations.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: are vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: says, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: looked at, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: explains, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: had found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The flaw, found by payments company Fallible, exposed names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses and sometimes the coordinates of those homes, as well as links to social media profiles. And Fallible contends that the leak still hasn't been properly fixed. I queried McDonald's to see if it has tried to seal the hole in the API and also whether it has notified customers or regulators, but I didn't get an immediate response. In a March 19 tweet, McDonald's didn't issue any clear answers, instead taking the well-trodden path of seeking to reassure users by highlighting what was not breached. McDonald's has dabbled in home delivery in many countries since the early 1990s, attracting budget diners willing to risk the short half-life of its sandwiches and fries versus the vagaries of home delivery. Fallible says it contacted McDonald's India on Feb 7, letting the fast-food chain know it could sequentially pull user information from the API using a curl request. \"An unprotected publicly accessible API endpoint for getting user details coupled with serially enumerable integers as customer IDs can be used to obtain access to all users personal information,\" Fallible writes in a blog post. But the issue appeared to remain unfixed, so Fallible says McDonald's another email on March 7 asking for a status update. Ten days later, it sent another email and received no response. Fallible chose to go public with the issue in a March 18 blog post, prompting a public acknowledgement from McDonald's on Twitter the next day. Fallible contends the issue hasn't been fixed, and it's unclear from McDonald's tweet if it was. India doesn't have a specific law that requires mandatory reporting of data breaches.

As a result, a database containing 1.5 million player profiles was compromised. On Sunday, ESEA posted a message to Twitter, reminding players of the warning issued on December 30, 2016, three days after they were informed of the hack. Sunday\u2019s message said the leak of player information was expected, but they\u2019ve not confirmed if the leaked records came from their systems. Late Saturday evening, breach notification service LeakedSource announced the addition of 1,503,707 ESEA records to their database. When asked for additional information by Salted Hash, a LeakedSource spokesperson shared the database schema, as well as sample records pulled at random from the database. Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need. However, in all, there are more than 90 fields associated with a given player record in the ESEA database. While the passwords are safe, the other data points in the leaked records could be used to construct a number of socially-based attacks, including Phishing. Players on Reddit have\u00a0confirmed their information was discovered in the leaked data. A similar confirmation was made Twitch\u2019s Jimmy Whisenhunt on Twitter. The LeakedSource spokesperson said that the ESEA hack was part of a ransom scheme, as the hacker responsible demanded $50,000 in payment. In exchange for meeting their demands, the hacker would keep silent about the ESEA hack and help the organization address the security flaw that made it possible. In their previous notification, ESEA said they learned about the incident on December 27, but make no mention of any related extortion attempts. The organization reset passwords, multi-factor authentication tokens, and security questions as part of their recovery efforts. We\u2019ve reached out to confirm the extortion attempt claims made by the hacker, as well as the total count for players affected by the data breach. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for ESL Gaming (parent company to Turtle Entertainment) confirmed that the hacker did in fact attempt to extort money, but the sum demanded was \"substantially higher\" than the $50,000 previously mentioned.

Specifically, the malicious Super Mario Run for Android package is infected with the Android Marcher Trojan, which now comes disguised as Nintendo\u2019s game, but features a similar behavior to what we\u2019ve seen in the past. Once it infects an Android device, it opens an overlay that requires users to enter their financial details whenever mobile banking apps are launched, and collected data is then saved and submitted to a command and control center owned by the attacker. In most of the cases, the Google Play Store can no longer launch as users are provided with the same overlay asking for financial details. \u201cIn previous variants of Marcher, we observed this malware family targeting well-known Australian, UK, and French banks.

They don't seem too critical on their own, but when combined, they allow attackers to create hidden administrative accounts and execute malicious PHP code on the underlying server. The exploit takes advantage of some false assumptions made by the developers, which Rubin described as a logic flaw, an Object Injection, a double SQL injection, and an overly permissive administrative dashboard. The logic issue stems from the reimplementation of a certain function without taking into account decisions made by the original function's developers. According to the researcher, it is the result of \"having too much code, too many developers and lacking documentation.\" \"Keep in mind that logical vulnerabilities can and will occur in almost all systems featuring a large code base,\" Rubin said. \"Security issues in large code bases is, of course, not Moodle specific.\" Gaining administrative privileges on the Moodle platform is not only dangerous because attackers could install a PHP backdoor by uploading malicious plug-ins or templates, but also because Moodle installations store sensitive and private information about students taking online courses[/INST]\n\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were resolved, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: became apparent, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The campaign, which has been active since at least January 2017, begins when a user receives an email written entirely in German. Its message informs the recipient they've attempted to pay for something online but that the transaction did not complete successfully The user must re-submit payment, the email demands, otherwise they could be penalized by a collection agency or even law enforcement. Sample of spam message seen targeting German users. Most of us know better than to fall for this type of scam, and the attackers know it. Which is why they've outfitted their attack emails with a technique that's designed to convince the recipient the notice is legitimate. Andrew Brandt, director of threat research at Symantec, elaborates on this point in a blog post: \"The key detail of each message was the fact that the recipient\u2019s full name, mailing address, and telephone number were embedded in the middle of the message.\" Brandt doesn't elaborate on how the attackers obtain users' personal information. Technically, bad actors can use Google and other tools to easily find these details.

Unlike the German campaign, however, the UK attack sought to trick users into clicking on links that led them to Maktub ransomware. No matter how convincing an email seems to be, it always pays to double check these kinds of claims by calling the company purportedly making the claim to confirm the message\u2019s authenticity (or to prove that it is false).\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: outfitted, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: convince, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: obtain, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the UK attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

In fact, the attack can be used to compromise all kinds of applications, but the researchers chose to focus on antivirus solutions since this type of software is generally considered to be trusted. \u201cBy using DoubleAgent, the attacker can take full control over the antivirus and do as he wish without the fear of being caught or blocked,\u201d they noted. This includes: Cybellum researchers demonstrated a DoubleAgent code injection against Symantec Norton antivirus, and offered PoC exploit code on GitHub. More technical details about the DoubleAgent technique can be found here. The researchers have notified major antivirus vendors of their findings, and some of them (Malwarebytes, AVG) have already issued a patch for the vulnerability. Among the still vulnerable antivirus apps are those by Avast, BitDefender, ESET, Kaspersky, and F-Secure. \u201cMicrosoft has provided a new design concept for antivirus vendors called Protected Processes. The new concept is specially designed for antivirus services. Antivirus processes can be created as \u2018Protected Processes\u2019 and the protected process infrastructure only allows trusted, signed code to load and has built-in defense against code injection attacks,\u201d the researchers explained.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discover, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: have already issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

That\u2019s sharp increase from last week when 2,000 MongoDB had been hijacked by two or three criminals. A wave attacks was first spotted on Dec. 27 by Victor Gevers, an ethical hacker and founder of GDI Foundation. That\u2019s when he said a hacker going by the handle \u201cHarak1r1\u201d was compromising open MongoDB installations, deleting their contents, and leaving behind a ransom note demanding 0.2 BTC (about $220). Victims would discover they were hit with the data theft only when they accessed the MongoDB and came across a top database field with the ransom demand that read, \u201cContact this email with your IP of your server to recover your database\u201d. Escalation of the attacks happened fast jumping from 200 14 days ago to 2,000 the following week. On Friday the numbers were at\u00a010,000, and by Monday Merrigan said there was\u00a0a huge spike in attacks via his Twitter account reporting 27,000 servers compromised representing 93 terabytes of data gone. Since identifying \u201cHarak1r1\u201d as the original attacker, they say more than\u00a0a dozen additional hackers are now actively targeting MongoDB installations as well. Researchers said that in many cases, data stored in the MongoDB now is simply being destroyed and when victims pay the ransom they do not receive their data back. Last week, Gevers told Threatpost attackers were battling among themselves. He said, when one hacker would leave a ransom note, another hacker would target the same database, delete the original ransom note and leave their own. This further complicates a victim\u2019s ability to retrieve data even if a ransom is paid, he said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: held for ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransom note demanding, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: would leave, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: leave their own, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransom is paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The hackers are using an alleged cache of stolen email accounts and passwords as leverage in an attempt to extort the world\u2019s most valuable company. They claim to have access to as many as 559 million Apple email and iCloud accounts, Vice blog Motherboard reported on Tuesday. The group, calling itself \u201cTurkish Crime Family,\u201d said it would delete its alleged list of compromised login credentials only after Apple pays it $75,000 in cryptocurrency, either Bitcoin or rival Ether, or $100,000 worth of iTunes gift cards, Motherboard reported. The group has given Apple (aapl) a deadline of April 7 to meet its demands. Though Apple has not officially confirmed the authenticity of the data that the hackers say they have, an Apple spokesperson told Fortune in an emailed statement that, if the list is legitimate, it was not obtained through any hack of Apple. \u201cThere have not been any breaches in any of Apple\u2019s systems including iCloud and Apple ID,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services\u201d. A person familiar with the contents of the alleged data set said that many of the email accounts and passwords contained within it matched data leaked in a past breach at LinkedIn. The company representative declined to elaborate on what steps Apple had taken to monitor the situation. The spokesperson merely noted that such measures, whatever they may be, are \u201cstandard procedure\u201d. Apple customers who secure their iCloud accounts with the same passwords they use on other online accounts\u2014especially ones at LinkedIn, Yahoo (yhoo), Dropbox, and other sites recently revealed to have suffered big breaches over the past few years\u2014should adopt new passwords that are long, strong, and unique.

The vulnerability allows an attacker to make all endpoints with compromised SAP GUI clients automatically install malware that locks their computers when an SAP user logs in to the system. When the user next logs into the SAP GUI application, the malicious software will run and prevent them from logging on to SAP Server. Firstly, in this case, patching process is especially laborious and time-consuming, as the vulnerability affects client side, so an SAP administrator has to apply the patch on every endpoint with SAP GUI in a company and a typical enterprise has thousands of them,\u201d said Vahagn Vardanyan, senior security researcher, ERPScan. The vulnerability was patched by SAP with a fix as part of its March Security Note 2407616. An SAP spokesperson confirmed that a SAP GUI vulnerability was fixed in the March Patch Day, with further details available via this blog post. \u201cIt has a priority of High, based on CVSS rating of 8.0 (but not Very High). We have no information or evidence of this vulnerability being exploited at a customer but advise all customers to patch their infrastructure immediately.

The security vendor claimed such attacks have grown both in volume and sophistication. Also known as \u201cCEO fraud\u201d and \u201cwhaling\u201d, these attacks typically involve fraudsters spoofing the email addresses of company CEOs to trick staff members into transferring funds outside the company. However, Proofpoint also includes attempts to target HR teams for confidential tax information and sensitive employee data, as well as engineering departments which may have access to a wealth of lucrative corporate IP. In its analysis of over 5000 global enterprise customers, it claimed that in two-thirds of cases the attacker spoofed the \u201cfrom\u201d email domain to display the same as that of the targeted company. These attacks can thwart some systems, because they don\u2019t feature malware as such \u2013 just a combination of this domain spoofing and social engineering of the victim to force them to pay up. Part of the trick is to harry the target, rushing them so they have less time to think about what they\u2019re doing. That\u2019s why over 70% of the most common BEC subject line families appraised by Proofpoint featured the words \u201cUrgent\u201d, \u201cPayment\u201d and \u201cRequest\u201d. The vendor claimed that firms in the manufacturing, retail and technology sectors are especially at risk, as cyber-criminals repeatedly look to take advantage of more complex supply chains and SaaS infrastructures. Vice-president of products, Robert Holmes, argued that although employee education was important, it needs to be complemented by the right set of tools to weed out fraudulent emails. \u201cWhen it comes to BEC attacks, employees should never be an organization\u2019s first line of defense. It is the organization\u2019s responsibility to ensure that security technologies are in place, so that BEC attacks are stopped before they can reach their intended target,\u201d he told Infosecurity Magazine.

The group is asking for either $75,000 in Bitcoin or $100,000 in iTunes gift cards before the April 7 deadline. Turkish Crime Family (let\u2019s call them TCF) was first reported by Vice\u2019s Motherboard as having 559 million total accounts\u2014and other reports say there are either 200 million or 300 million vulnerable iPhone accounts. Regardless of the number, it\u2019s a lot\u2014and on the surface the news, if TCF really does have those credentials, would indicate that Apple has suffered a major data breach.

But that said, do consumers really want to roll the dice with their pictures and other information on the phone? Lamar Bailey, director of security research and development for Tripwire, said via email that the hackers may have indeed been able to meticulously assemble a cohesive database of previously stolen Apple credentials by making use of various former data breaches of sources outside of Apple\u2014this is a good highlight once again of the widespread problem of password re-use. It would have required a large effort, but he noted that it could be done. \u201cIf this is legit, the hackers would have had to obtain access to the individual user accounts via breaking the passwords of each of the user accounts or have acquired access to the Apple iCloud servers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe access to each user account is much more realistic since we have seen numerous reports of all the weak passwords people use for their computers and accounts\u201d. And, he added, if the hackers have password access to individual user accounts, they can indeed erase phones remotely and change passwords for the Apple account. \u201cThe hackers cannot remove backups for Apple devices from the cloud, but changing the passwords will make it hard for the legitimate users to reset and recover their devices,\u201d he noted. \u201cOnce the end-user has access to their account, they will be able to restore their device\u201d.

A more plausible explanation, they say, is that crooks used credential stuffing attacks to amass a limited number of valid Apple usernames and passwords in attempt to extort money from Apple. Earlier this week, the group identifying itself as the Turkish Crime Family claimed to have a database of 750 million iCloud.com, me.com and mac.com email addresses and credentials. \u201cThere have not been any breaches in any of Apple\u2019s systems including iCloud and Apple ID,\u201d Apple said in a statement. \u201cThe alleged list of email addresses and passwords appears to have been obtained from previously compromised third-party services\u201d. Hackers behind the claim are demanding Apple pay them $75,000 in cryptocurrency or give them $100,000 in iTunes vouchers, according to reports. If\u00a0 demands are not met by April 7, the group said it will begin deleting data stored on iCloud accounts en masse. An independent analysis of 54 samples of the breached account data provided to ZDNet by the hackers were valid. However, security experts such as Troy Hunt, who runs the data breach repository HaveIBeenPwned.com, still isn\u2019t convinced. Hunt told Threatpost he suspects the hack is a hoax, admitting he has not seen the any samples of the breached data. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely possible whoever is behind this could have username and password pairs that work on a limited number of Apple accounts in just the same way as re-used credentials will work across all sorts of other accounts,\u201d Hunt said. He said the Turkish Crime Family likely has a far smaller pool of valid Apple credentials than it claims. Shuman Ghosemajumder, CTO of the firm Shape Security told Threatpost he suspects the hackers may have used credential stuffing attacks, using data from previous breaches, to gain access to an undetermined number of iCloud accounts.

More specifically, the year of crypto-ransomware, that nefarious variant that encrypts files and holds them captive until a ransom is paid. Since the release of Cryptolocker in late 2013, crypto-ransomware has exploded, and 2016 was a banner year. As a matter of fact, according to the FBI, cyber criminals used ransomware to steal more than $209 million from U.S. businesses in just the first quarter of 2016. And according to a recent report from Kaspersky Labs, from January to September of 2016, ransomware attacks targeting companies increased by a whopping 300 percent. With threat actors realizing ransomware\u2019s lucrative potential, they bombarded the industry with new attacks in 2016. This variant hit the wild in early 2016, infecting systems using AES encryption. It not only infects mapped file shares, but any networked share, so remote drives are at risk. This attack was so potent experts estimate it infected more than 100,000 victims per day at its peak. More recently, hackers went after the beloved San Francisco Municipal Transport Agency (MUNI). If you were in the area in late November, you may have gotten the message \u201cYou Hacked\u201d at public transit ticket kiosks. The city\u2019s light rail was hit by ransomware that forced them to offer free rides for two days while they recovered the files. Or, what about Popcorn, the ingenious little in-development ransomware variant in December that turned victims into attackers by incentivizing them with a pyramid scheme-style discount. Send the infection to two of your friends, and you get your files back for free. Ransomware perhaps hit healthcare the hardest in 2016, with some reports claiming 88 percent of all ransomware affected hospitals. Whether large or small, no provider could hide from hackers looking to nab and encrypt patient data, disrupting care until the provider paid up or recovered files. The New Jersey Spine Center and Marin Healthcare District were attacked by Cryptowall, which encrypted electronic health records, backup files and the phone system. MedStar, which operates 10 hospitals in the D.C and Baltimore area, was forced to shut down its entire IT system and revert to paper records.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a ransom is paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: used ransomware to steal, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: forced them to offer, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid up, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: were attacked, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Criminals have obviously realized the awesome money-making potential of ransomware, and you should expect them to double-down in 2017. That said, how can they make an already effective threat even more widespread? Every year I try to predict changes and evolutions to the threat and security landscape. In this year\u2019s predictions, I forecast that you\u2019ll see the first ever, wide-spread ransomworm. This new variant will dramatically accelerate the spread of ransomware. Years ago, network worms like CodeRed, SQL Slammer, and more recently, Conficker were pretty common. As you probably know, a worm is a type of malware that automatically spreads itself over a network, using either legitimate network file sharing features, or network software vulnerabilities. In the past, the fastest spreading worms \u2013 like the examples mentioned above \u2013 exploited network software flaws to automatically propagate through networks (whether the Internet or just your internal network). Although we haven\u2019t seen many wildly successful network worms lately, they\u2019re still a threat. All it takes is for one black hat to find a new zero-day networking software flaw and wide-spread ransomworm becomes a real possibility. In fact, attackers may not even need to know a new networking flaw to create a successful ransomware. By stealing a computer\u2019s local credentials, attackers can use normal Windows networking, or tools like Powershell to spread through an internal Windows network without leveraging any vulnerability at all. Now, imagine ransomware attached to such a network worm. After infecting one victim, it could tirelessly copy itself to every computer it could reach on your local network. Whether or not you want to imagine such a scenario, criminals have already added network-scanning capabilities to some ransomware variants, and there\u2019s a high likelihood they will more aggressively merge ransomware and worm capabilities next year. In 2017, I suspect you\u2019ll see a ransomworm that automatically spreads very quickly and successfully, at least on local networks, if not the Internet.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: find, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: stealing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Backup \u2013 Sure, I know most people just want to prevent ransomware, but you\u2019ll never have 100 percent assurances of that in information security. Backing up your data is an important part of security for reasons far beyond just recovering from a ransomware attack. If you don\u2019t already backup your important data, ransomware is the best reason yet to do so. Patch your software \u2013 There are many ways ransomware might get on your systems, including just users manually doing foolish things. However, in order to forcefully or automatically install malware on your system, attackers must exploit software flaws. That said, vendors have already fixed a huge percent of the vulnerabilities hackers use to spread malware. If you simply keep your patches up to date, you won\u2019t succumb to many of these forced or automated attacks, which could even help against ransomworms, assuming the network flaw they used was also patched. Implement Killchain Defense \u2013 You won\u2019t find one security technology that can protect you from 100 percent of ransomware by itself. However, there are many security controls that help protect you from various stages of a ransomware attack. For instance, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) can prevent some of the exploits criminals use to spread ransomware. AntiVirus can catch some of the most common ransomware variants, and more modern advanced threat protection solutions can even identify and block new zero-day ransomware samples. However, none of these defenses are fool proof alone. The best way to protect your computer or organization is to combine all of them.

Once in, they could deplete the battery or administer incorrect pacing or shocks, the FDA said on Monday. The devices, like pacemakers and defibrillators, are used to monitor and control patients' heart functions and prevent heart attacks. St. Jude has developed a software patch to fix the vulnerabilities, and it will automatically be applied to affected devices beginning Monday. To receive the patch, the Merlin@home Transmitter must be plugged in and connected to the Merlin.net network. The FDA said patients can continue to use the devices, and no patients were harmed as a result of the vulnerabilities. Abbott Laboratories (ABT), which recently acquired St. Jude in a deal worth $25 billion, said it has worked with the FDA and DHS to update and improve the security of the affected devices. \"Cybersecurity, including device security, is an industry-wide challenge and all implanted devices with remote monitoring have potential vulnerabilities,\" Candace Steele Flippin, a spokeswoman for Abbott, told CNNMoney in an email. \"As we've been doing for years, we will continue to actively address cybersecurity risks and potential vulnerabilities and enhance our systems.\" The FDA said hackers could control a device by accessing its transmitter. In August 2016, Muddy Waters founder Carson Block published a report claiming St. Jude's devices could be hacked and said he was shorting the stock. St. Jude said the claims were \"absolutely untrue,\" and in September, it filed a lawsuit against the firm. In a statement, Block said Monday's announcement \"vindicates\" the firm's research. \"It also reaffirms our belief that had we not gone public, St. Jude would not have remediated the vulnerabilities,\" Block said. \"Regardless, the announced fixes do not appear to address many of the larger problems, including the existence of a universal code that could allow hackers to control the implants.\" The confirmation of St. Jude's vulnerabilities is the latest reminder of how internet-connected devices can put health at risk.

The scammers have purchased a large number of different domains, and equipped them with obfuscated JavaScript code that would trigger the bug in Mobile Safari. The intended targets were mostly from English-speaking countries: the US, the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand. The attack was contained within Safari\u2019s sandbox, so the victims\u2019 devices were not actually compromised.The attackers banked on users\u2019 fear and shame to pull the scam off. Lookout notified Apple of the attack, and the iThings manufacturer fixed the abused flaw in iOS 10.3, which was released on Monday. \u201cThe pop-up window error dialog on newer versions of iOS is actually the result of Mobile Safari not being able to find a local URL lookup, so it fails, but keeps presenting the dialog message due to the infinite loop in the code,\u201d the researchers explained. \u201cThe attack, based on its code, seems to have been developed for older versions of iOS, such as iOS 8. However, the abuse of pop-ups in Mobile Safari was still possible until iOS 10.3\u201d.

Successful exploitation could result in denial of service condition or \u00a0arbitrary code execution in the context of the user running the application. According to the researchers who found this flaw, this vulnerability was exploited in the wild in July or August 2016. Other threat actors are now in the stages of creating malicious code based on the original proof-of-concept (PoC) code. Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV) is an extension of the HTTP protocol that allows clients to perform remote Web content authoring operations. WebDAV extends the set of standard HTTP methods and headers allowed for the HTTP request. Few example of WebDAV methods are COPY, LOCK, MKCOL, PROPFIND, UNLOCK etc. This vulnerability is exploited using the PROPFIND method and IF header. The PROPFIND method retrieves properties defined on the resource identified by the Request-URI. All the WebDAV-Compliant resources must support the PROPFIND method. The IF header handles the state token as well as the ETags. It makes the request conditional by supplying a series of state lists with conditions that match tokens and ETags to specific resource. If all states present in the IF header fail, the request fails with 412 (Precondition Failed) status[/INST]\n\nTrigger: is vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The message currently displayed on the Dueling Network forum. \"Only our forum site was still up as a way for our users to communicate with each other (login used DN [Dueling Network] credentials). Now that is down and warns users to change passwords on any other sites they may have used the same password on,\" Black Luster Soldier, a Dueling Network administrator, told Motherboard in an email. The hacker appears to have stolen at least 6.5 million accounts, although Black Luster Soldier cautioned that not all of those necessarily correspond to individual players. \"At the moment, the claim that information has been breached for 6.5 DN million accounts appears to be accurate. Note that many accounts are duplicates owned by the same user or were never actually logged in, so this number is inflated,\" they said. The data includes user email addresses and passwords hashed with the notoriously weak MD5 algorithm, meaning hackers will likely be able to obtain a number of users' plaintext passwords as well. Paid breach notification service LeakBase provided Motherboard with a small sample of accounts for verification purposes. Motherboard attempted to contact over 50 alleged victims, but has not received a reply at the time of writing. Black Luster Soldier's working theory is that the hacker used a vulnerability in MySQL to obtain the data. The lesson: As Black Luster Soldier advised, users should change their passwords on any other services with the same credentials as Dueling Network.

Russia's alleged\u00a0use of computer hacking to interfere with the U.S. presidential election fits a pattern of similar incidents across Europe for at least a decade. Cyberattacks in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany, France\u00a0and Austria that investigators attributed to suspected Russian hackers\u00a0appeared\u00a0aimed at influencing election results, sowing discord and undermining faith in public institutions that included\u00a0government\u00a0agencies, the media and elected officials. Those investigations bolster U.S. intelligence findings of Russian meddling to help elect Donald Trump, a conclusion the president-elect has\u00a0disputed \u2014 although he conceded Friday after a private intelligence briefing that Russia was among the possible hacking culprits. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very good at using the West\u2019s weaknesses against itself, the open Internet to hack, the free media to sow discord, and to cause people to question the underpinnings of the systems under which they live,\u201d said Hannah Thoburn, a research fellow at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank.

They\u00a0blamed the attacks on a pro-Russia group called CyberBerkut. Hudson analyst Thoburn, who was working as an election observer in Ukraine at the time, said the Ukrainians were able to get around it by deleting\u00a0their entire system and restoring it from a backup that was not contaminated. Ukrainian officials have also accused Russia of being behind a power grid attack in December 2015 that cut power to 80,000 in western Ukraine. In overt actions against Ukraine, Russia seized the province of Crimea in 2014 and helped armed separatists launch a rebellion in eastern Ukraine. German intelligence in 2015 accused Russia of hacking at least 15 computers belonging to members of Germany\u2019s lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, and stealing data.

The incident\u00a0\u201ccompromised the confidentiality\u201d of the organization\u2019s IT networks, Podzic said. The French daily Le Monde, which first reported the incident, cited a Western intelligence agency attributing the attack to the Russia-linked group APT28, aka Fancy Bear, and Sofacy. Russia,\u00a0a member of the OSCE, has objected to the group\u2019s criticism of Russian-backed forces battling the Ukrainian government\u00a0in eastern Ukraine. Russian hackers posing as the \u201cCyber Caliphate\u201d were suspected of attacking France\u2019s TV5Monde television channel in 2014, causing extensive damage to the company\u2019s computer systems, FireEye, a cyber security firm that examined the attack, told BuzzFeed. The attack\u00a0involved posting of Islamic State propaganda, but appeared to use the same servers and have other similarities with Russian-linked APT28, the group that is a suspect in attacks on the Democratic National Committee, the OSCE and several other European countries. \u201cAPT28 focuses on collecting intelligence that would be most useful to a government,\u201d FireEye said. \u201cSpecifically, since at least 2007, APT28 has been targeting privileged information related to governments, militaries and security organizations that would likely benefit the Russian government\u201d.

While cybercriminals using the lure of fake travel itineraries to dupe staff working in sectors reliant on shipping goods or employee travel isn't new,  researchers have uncovered a particularly advanced phishing attack. Discovered by cybersecurity researchers at Barracuda Networks, this airline phishing attack uses a variety of techniques to capture sensitive data from victims and deploy an advanced persistent threat. The email from the attacker impersonates a travel agency or an employee in the target's own HR or finance department. The email's subject line claims it's a forwarded message about a flight confirmation, stating the airline, the destination, and the price of the flight. All three of these elements are carefully researched by the attackers, who select them specifically according to the target, in order to make the email look legitimate in context of the company and the email recipient. Taking the time to tailor phishing emails in this way works: these messages are opened 90 percent of the time, one of the highest success rates for phishing attacks, according to Barracuda. Once opened, the email presents the target with an attachment in the form of a PDF or Microsoft Word document. The attachment purports to be a flight confirmation or receipt but, of course, it's neither of these things. When the target opens the attachment, the malware runs immediately, dropping an advanced persistent threat into the network, and enabling the attacker to stealthily monitor the infected organisation -- likely with the aim conducting espionage and stealing data. Another variant of this attack which, instead of dropping malware to stealthily steal data, uses phishing links to directly take sensitive information from the victim. These phishing links are ultimately designed to trick the victim into supplying sensitive corporate credentials, which the attackers will then use to infiltrate the company network, databases, and emails in order to steal information. Cybersecurity researchers warn that the combined use of impersonation, malware, and phishing is particularly dangerous because these methods complement one another, enabling the attacker to essentially gain control of the network. At this stage, the attackers can stealthily conduct espionage or even drop additional malware and ransomware.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: mimicking, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: dupe, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: impersonates, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claims, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: tailor, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: purports to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: stealing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: this attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

According to Palo Alto Networks, the sheer size of the market, the tendency of people to neglect their superannuation, and technology advancements making it easier to commit identity theft are all factors behind the strong interest among cybercriminals in super funds. Because superannuation transactions are now conducted digitally, rather than face to face, identity theft has become easier. Cybercriminals are exploiting a range of techniques, including phishing, to steal victims\u2019 identities before transferring their super into self-managed accounts or applying for hardship payments. Unlike banks, super funds have no obligation to reimburse victims of fraud, and if the fraud takes place overseas there is very little chance of recovering stolen money, Palo Alto said. Cybercriminals are also increasingly targeting the industry with malware, with the number of new threats discovered growing to 350,000 per month in 2017, up from just 300 per month a decade ago. \u201cBecause superannuation funds are such valuable targets, cybercriminals are unlikely to turn their attention elsewhere anytime soon. Therefore, it\u2019s imperative for superannuation providers to review their security measures in minute detail, seeking out every potential vulnerability and finding a way to close the gaps before cybercriminals exploit them,\u201d Palo Alto Regional CSO for APAC Sean Duca said. \u201cA solid security strategy should go beyond antivirus and intrusion detection systems[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Experts identified a total of 16 security-related issues, including 8 weaknesses that only affect NTP and two that only impact NTPsec, which is meant to be a secure, hardened and improved implementation of NTP. Cure53 has published separate reports focusing on the NTP and NTPsec problems. The Network Time Foundation addressed the flaws earlier this month with the release of ntp-4.2.8p10. Cure53 has classified one vulnerability as being critical. CVE-2017-6460, which only affects NTP, has been described as a stack-based buffer overflow that can be triggered by a malicious server when a client requests the restriction list. The flaw can be exploited to cause a crash and possibly to execute arbitrary code. The security holes rated by Cure53 as high severity are CVE-2017-6463 and CVE-2017-6464, both of which can be exploited for DoS attacks. It\u2019s worth noting that while some of the vulnerabilities have been classified as critical and high severity by Cure53, NTP developers have only assigned medium, low and informational-level severity ratings to the discovered flaws. Ntp-4.2.8p10 patches a total of 15 vulnerabilities and also includes just as many non-security fixes and improvements. Of the 15 security holes resolved in the latest version, 14 were discovered by Cure53, which also noticed that a flaw initially patched in December 2014 was reintroduced in November 2016.

But the window to this sort of hijacking is far wider than originally thought because a researcher in Israel has uncovered 40 unknown vulnerabilities, or zero-days, that would allow someone to remotely hack millions of newer Samsung smart TVs, smart watches, and mobile phones already on the market, as well as ones slated for future release, without needing physical access to them. The security holes are in an open-source operating system called Tizen that Samsung has been rolling out in its devices over the last few years. It already has Tizen running on some 30 million smart TVs, as well as Samsung Gear smartwatches and in some Samsung phones in a limited number of countries like Russia, India and Bangladesh\u2014the company plans to have 10 million Tizen phones in the market this year. Samsung also announced earlier this year that Tizen would be the operating system on its new line of smart washing machines and refrigerators too. But the operating system is riddled with serious security vulnerabilities that make it easy for a hacker to take control of Tizen-powered devices, according to Israeli researcher Amihai Neiderman. A Samsung Z1 with the Tizen operating system on display at the Mobile World Congress 2015 in Barcelona, Spain. But one security hole Neiderman uncovered was particularly critical. It involves Samsung's TizenStore app\u2014Samsung's version of Google Play Store\u2014which delivers apps and software updates to Tizen devices. Neiderman says a flaw in its design allowed him to hijack the software to deliver malicious code to his Samsung TV. Because the TizenStore software operates with the highest privileges you can get on a device, it's the Holy Grail for a hacker who can abuse it. \"You can update a Tizen system with any malicious code you want,\" he says. Although TizenStore does use authentication to make sure only authorized Samsung software gets installed on a device, Neiderman found a heap-overflow vulnerability\u00a0that gave him control before that authentication function kicked in. Although researchers have uncovered problems with other Samsung devices in the past, Tizen has escaped extensive scrutiny from the security community, probably because it's not widely used on phones yet.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has uncovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is riddled, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: uncovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: says, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have uncovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

He says much of the Tizen code base is old and borrows from previous Samsung coding projects, including Bada, a previous mobile phone operating system that Samsung discontinued. \"You can see that they took all this code and tried to push it into Tizen,\" Neiderman says. But most of the vulnerabilities he found were actually in new code written specifically for Tizen within the last two years. Many of them are the kind of mistakes programmers were making twenty years ago, indicating that Samsung lacks basic code development and review practices to prevent and catch such flaws. But there's a basic flaw in it whereby it fails to check if there is enough space to write the data, which can create a buffer overrun condition that attackers can exploit. A buffer overrun occurs when the space to which data is being written is too small for the data, causing the data to write to adjacent areas of memory. A Tizen stand at the at the Mobile World Congress 2015 in Barcelona, Spain. They use it on some data transmissions but not others, and usually not on ones that need it most. \"They made a lot of wrong assumptions about where they needed encryption,\" he says, noting that \"it's extra work to move between secure connections and unsecure connections.\" This indicates that they didn't do it inadvertently but were making conscious decisions not to use SSL in those places, he says.

Designated CVE-2017-7269, that\u2019s bad news, but the fact that it has been known about for months \u2013 with new exploits now likely \u2013 is the main takeaway. Given that IIS 6.0 shipped with Windows Server 2003 R2 in 2005 and Microsoft stopped supporting it after the end of life deadline passed in July 2015 (ie no more patches), one might assume that the install base is small. More likely, this is another version of the Windows XP situation where organisations find it hard to wean themselves off core software and end up putting themselves at risk. In 2015, research from analysts RiskIQ found 2,675 installs of IIS 6.0 inside 24 of the top FTSE-100 UK companies alone. Incredibly, the same analysis found 417 installs of IIS 5.0 in the same companies, which at that time was a year beyond extended support death. Shodan estimates 600,000 machines still visibly running this software globally, perhaps 10% of which have the PROPFIND extension running according to an analysis by one enterprising researcher. Nobody knows, but with Microsoft unlikely to step in with a fix, it could be more than enough to cause problems. The premium fix is to stop using IIS 6.0 immediately but for anyone who finds that difficult there is one hope: guerrilla patching. We discussed this phenomenon in our recent coverage of Google\u2019s \u201cOperation Rosehub\u201d, but it can be summed up by the simple idea that if the vendor in whose software a vulnerability has arisen can\u2019t or won\u2019t fix the issue then someone else does it for them.

The group, dubbed APT10, is using custom-made malware and spear phishing to gain access to target companies. The National Cyber Security Centre and cyber units at PwC and BAE Systems collaborated to identify the group. \"Operating alone, none of us would have joined the dots to uncover this new campaign of indirect attacks,\" said Richard Horne, cyber security partner at PwC. A detailed report drawn up by the three organisations reveals that the group has been active since 2014 but ramped up its attacks in late 2016. In particular, said the report, it targeted firms who ran key IT functions on behalf of large UK companies. PwC and BAE said the group had mounted many different attacks as part of a campaign they called Operation Cloud Hopper. By targeting the suppliers of IT outsourcing, the attackers were able to stealthily gain access to the networks and systems of their true targets. Dr Adrian Nish, head of threat intelligence at BAE, said the attackers used these third parties as a \"stepping stone\" to get at the companies and organisations they were really interested in. Infiltrating supply chains gave the attackers an easy route into many different targets. \"Organisations large and small rely on these providers for management of core systems and as such they can have deep access to sensitive data,\" he said. \"It is impossible to say how many organisations might be impacted altogether at this point.\" The security organisations involved in exposing the APT10 campaign say they have seen firms in the UK, Europe and Japan being targeted by the group. The National Cyber Security Centre and the two security firms have warned known victims that they have been compromised.

Security researchers in Israel have uncovered 40 previously undiscovered vulnerabilities in the operating system running in Samsung\u2019s line of smart televisions, smartwatches, and even mobile phones, which could give hackers easy access to the devices, Motherboard is reporting after discussing the findings with the researchers. Tens of millions of electronics could be at risk, security researcher Amihai Neiderman told Motherboard. The security flaws are living inside Tizen, an operating system Samsung (SSNLF) has been developing over the last several years that runs on the company\u2019s televisions, smartwatches, and some low-powered mobile devices. Hackers with knowledge of the vulnerabilities can be half a world away but connect over the Internet to a Samsung television or wearable, and assume complete control over the device. Neiderman didn\u2019t say if hackers have been exploiting some of the flaws built into Tizen, and he has only been analyzing the software for the past eight months. He believes that many of the 40 flaws\u2014called zero day exploits because there are no fixes and hackers could take advantage of them right now\u2014were caused by Samsung coding errors that were never discovered in product testing[/INST]\n\nTrigger: reportedly have, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have uncovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is reporting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the findings, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are living inside, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were never discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The research, carried out by One Poll, quizzed 500 IT decision makers in companies with 250 or more employees across the UK to uncover the extent to which large British organisations are prepared for the threat of ransomware. The research also considered the proportion of businesses which have been targeted with a successful ransomware attack and the current impact of these attacks on corporate devices. 45 percent of large British businesses have fallen victim to a successful ransomware attack. Despite this, 11 percent of large organisations still do not have a formal ransomware policy in place. Although British businesses are increasingly threatened by this strain of malware, 38 percent of these unprepared businesses are not planning to implement a ransomware-focused policy in the next 12 months. Conversely, half of this group confirmed that firm plans are in place to put such a policy into practice in the next year. \u201cCybercriminals are continuing to exploit British businesses by launching ransomware attacks to remove access to mission-critical data or to make significant sums of money by demanding large ransoms for the safe return of such data. Despite this, many organisations have yet to take action and implement policies which will ensure the IT network is well prepared for a possible attack,\u201d said Chris Mayers, chief security architect, Citrix. \u201cBy committing to robust cybersecurity techniques and ensuring specific policies are in place in case of an attack, companies can lessen the chances of falling prey to ransomware and creating any vulnerabilities for cyber-attackers to find\u201d. The poll also dug into the extent to which ransomware attacks have affected corporate devices and systems, revealing that IT often faces significant numbers of infected devices. On average, businesses reported that 47 devices had been infected by their most recent ransomware attack but one third of businesses with over 1000 employees reported that more than 101 devices were affected. Among those organisations which had fallen victim to a ransomware attack, 31 percent saw 25 or fewer devices affected. \u201cFalling prey to a ransomware campaign can have a devastating effect on a business, from the loss of highly sensitive corporate data to reduced revenues and a sharp decline in public trust.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a recent ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a successful ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a successful ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: launching ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding large ransoms, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: their most recent ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransomware campaign, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The open-source Xen hypervisor is used by cloud computing providers and virtual private server hosting companies, as well as by security-oriented operating systems like Qubes OS. The new vulnerability affects Xen 4.8.x, 4.7.x, 4.6.x, 4.5.x, and 4.4.x and has existed in the Xen code base for over four years. It was unintentionally introduced in December 2012 as part of a fix for a different issue. The Xen project released a patch Tuesday that can be applied manually to vulnerable deployments. The good news is that the vulnerability can only be exploited from 64-bit paravirtualized guest operating systems. Xen supports two types of virtual machines: Hardware Virtual Machines (HVMs), which use hardware-assisted virtualization, and paravirtualized (PV) VMs that use software-based virtualization. Based on whether they use PV VMs, Xen users might be affected or not. For example, Amazon Web Services said in an advisory that its customers' data and instances were not affected by this vulnerability and no customer action is required. Meanwhile, virtual private server provider Linode had to reboot some of its legacy Xen servers in order to apply the fix. Qubes OS, an operating system that uses Xen to isolate applications inside virtual machines, also put out an advisory warning that an attacker who exploits another vulnerability, for example inside a browser, can exploit this Xen issue to compromise the whole Qubes system. The Qubes developers have released a patched Xen package for Qubes 3.1 & 3.2 and reiterated their intention to stop using paravirtualization altogether in the upcoming Qubes 4.0. Vulnerabilities that allow breaking the isolation layer of virtual machines can be very valuable for attackers.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was unintentionally introduced, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were not affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: apply, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: put out an advisory warning, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: can exploit, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The campaign \u2013 now defunct \u2013 started with an email informing users they needed to update their account details. From there, victims were brought\u00a0to a legitimate looking Netflix login page where they were asked their email address and Netflix password. Not content with just getting users\u2019 login credentials, the attacker then directs victims to another form where they\u2019re told they need\u00a0to update their billing information. Users are encouraged to enter their name, birthdate, address, and credit card information. The attacker perhaps overdid it by asking users to provide their social security number \u2013 something Netflix would never ask for \u2013 and users\u2019 VBV (Verified by Visa) 3D Secure Code, a fairly new service that Visa uses in Europe and India but that hasn\u2019t been deployed in the U.S. yet. While the pages mimic actual Netflix pages and even feature a yellow \u201csecure server\u201d lock, they\u2019re completely fake. Mohammed Mohsin Dalla, a researcher with FireEye\u2019s Threat Research team who uncovered the campaign, notes that until it was taken down, the campaign was adept at bypassing phishing filters. He\u00a0claims the campaign used AES encryption to encode the content it served up, something that would have made it easy for it to evade detection. \u201cBy obfuscating the webpage, attackers try to deceive text-based classifiers and prevent them from inspecting webpage content,\u201d Dalla wrote of the scam Monday, \u201cthis technique employs two files, a PHP and a JavaScript file that have functions to encrypt and decrypt input strings. The PHP file is used to encrypt the webpages at the server side\u2026 at the client side, the encrypted content is decoded using a defined function in the JavaScript file\u201d. Phishing campaigns that target Netflix customers aren\u2019t revolutionary but this one was different because of the way it\u00a0evaded detection and served up its phishing pages.

It's businesses that must be extra careful when filing, because businesses are experiencing a rise in tax-related scams, specifically W-2 fraud. Researchers at IBM X-Force, the tech giant's security research division, discovered more than 1400% growth in general tax-themed spam between December 2016 and March 2017. \"On top of all the usual activity -- consumer tax fraud, filing on others' behalf -- we began to see that businesses are being targeted a lot more,\" says Limor Kessem, executive security advisor for IBM Security. In the past, she says, tax fraud on businesses were the purview of only advanced attackers. This year, they saw a rise in social engineering attacks on smaller organizations like schools, non-profits, and restaurants as fraudsters start to aim for the \"low-hanging fruit\" of the corporate world. Cybercriminals often collect W-2 data by pretending to be a company exec and emailing HR or payroll for employee information, which is used to file fraudulent returns and collect refunds. In addition, they may also request a wire transfer to a specific bank account. Attackers who are more technically inclined may bypass the fake emails and breach an organization's servers to steal data directly, says Kessem. In addition to using W-2 data for their own scams, fraudsters will sell it on the dark web, the report states. The most valuable bundles of information are called \"Fullz\" and contain the victim's address, contact info, Social Security and driver's license numbers, plus all W-2 and W-9 information. Each record runs for $40-$50 in Bitcoin on the Dark Web. With all this data for $50 per record, harmful activity doesn't have to stop at tax fraud, Kessem notes. Cybercriminals can buy and use this data for other scams like identity theft or online loan applications. Tax-related risks increase as the filing deadline approaches. One-third of Americans (54 million people) filed their taxes after April 1 in 2016, giving fraudsters a larger window of opportunity to strike. Tax-related cybercrime won't stop after April 18, 2017.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: collect, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: pretending to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Most recently, starting 2016, this group has switched to using legitimate Windows apps and fileless malware to hack into government agencies and banks in at least 40 countries. Because those attacks used stealthy techniques that left a minimal footprint on infected servers, investigators weren't able to detect what the crooks were after. Nevertheless, they suspected the hackers stole data from infected systems, albeit they didn't know what data. More clues about these attacks came to light only recently. Security researchers from Kaspersky Lab, the ones who identified the initial attacks this February, believe they uncovered the purpose of some of the bank hacks. Presenting at the Security Analyst Summit (SAS) held these days in St. Maarten, Kaspersky Lab researchers said crooks broke into the networks of various banks using various exploits, where they used legitimate Windows tools and PowerShell malware to escalate their access to nearby systems. Their target was the system that managed the bank's ATM network. Hackers used this system's remote management feature to connect to the ATMs via RDP. They then transferred and installed a new breed of ATM malware on these machines, which Kaspersky Lab experts called ATMitch. This malware worked by reading a local command.txt file for instructions. When attackers knew they had partners in front of specific ATMs, they'd upload instructions to the command.txt file and the malware would execute them, spewing out cash. Based on log entries, researchers believe the ATM printed on its screen the words \"Catch some money, bitch!\" It is unknown how many ATMs attackers emptied using this technique because the malware would self-delete once the attack would end, cleaning up all its files. It was only by accident that on one ATM the malware left behind a file named \"tv.dll.\" After further digging around, researchers were able to discover how the malware worked and traced it back to banks compromised by the same group they uncovered this past February. Right now, researchers tracked down only two incidents with ATMitch, to a bank in Russia and one in Kazakhstan, but they believe that many more have also taken place.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: stole, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

News of the campaigns coincides with Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s first official visit to the U.S. to meet with President Trump. It suggests that cyber-enabled espionage out of China continues to be an issue, despite a September 2015 agreement between the U.S and Chinese governments not to support or engage in such activities. \u201cEven as IP-focused cyber-espionage has\u00a0reduced since the Xi Jinping-Obama agreement, big business will continue to be targeted, if nothing else than for the influence they hold over governments,\u201d warns Hardik Modi, vice president of threat research at Fidelis Cybersecurity. Fidelis was one of the organizations that this week disclosed new cyber espionage activity by APT10, a well-known China-based advanced threat group that is also known as Stone Panda. The other warning about the APT10 group's resurgent activity, after a period of relative quiet, came from PwC UK and BAE Systems. According to Fidelis, its security researchers in February discovered a reconnaissance tool called \"Scanbox,\" previously associated with China government-sponsored threat actors, embedded on specific pages of the NFTC site. Among the infected page were those that NFTC board members used to register for meetings. It\u2019s unclear how the APT10 group initially breached the site in order to embed Scanbox on it. \u201cScanbox is a robust framework that can include a variety of reconnaissance modules,\u201d Modi says. It can, for instance, be used to determine the software running on a target system, the type and version of antivirus on it, and other details. \u201cIn some instances, it has been known to serve up a JavaScript keylogger that can be used to grab credentials that the target enters on the page,\u201d he says. NFTC members have been major contributors to the dialogue around the new U.S. trade policy framework being developed by the Trump Administration.

The proof-of-concept exploit was developed by Theori, a research and development firm in Austin, which opened its doors last spring. The PoC targets two vulnerabilities, CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201, in Microsoft Edge that were patched in November in MS16-129 and privately disclosed to Microsoft by Google Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich. French researcher Kafeine said on Saturday that he had spotted weaponized versions of the Theori exploits in Sundown two days after they were made public. The payload is most likely the Zloader DLL injector, but Sundown has also moved other malware in the past including banking Trojans such as Zeus Panda and Dreambot, and even Bitcoin mining software. Kafeine said this is the first significant exploit kit activity he\u2019s seen in six months. This is the second time a Theori proof-of-concept exploit has ended up in an exploit kit, Kafeine said, harkening back to CVE-2016-0189, which was patched in May by Microsoft and yet eventually found its way into Neutrino, RIG, Sundown and Magnitude. Kafeine said he expects other exploit kits to quickly integrate this attack as well, but activity could be slowed by Christmas and New Year holidays in the West, and the recently concluded Russian holiday season. A request for comment from researchers at Theori was not returned in time for publication. In the Readme for the exploits posted to Github, Theori said its PoC was tested on the latest version of Edge running on Windows 10. The vulnerabilities are in the Chakra JavaScript engine developed for Microsoft in Internet Explorer 9. The Theori exploits trigger information leak and type confusion vulnerabilities in the browser, leading to remote code execution. The bugs were patched Nov. 8 by Microsoft in a cumulative update for the Edge browser; Microsoft characterized them as memory corruption flaws and rated them both critical for Windows clients and moderate for Windows server. An attacker could also embed an ActiveX control marked \u2018safe for initialization\u2019 in an application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the Edge rendering engine.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was developed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: privately disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: characterized, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The vulnerability affected all Windows versions, either 32 or 64 bits, and was reported and later described in more detail by Laurent Gaffi\u00e9 (@PythonResponder) the same day that the fix was published. He also published proof-of-concept (PoC) code triggering the vulnerability. When the LSASS service crashes, the target is automatically restarted after 60 seconds, which is not very nice when it's a production server. As this allocation is close to 4GB, this will probably fail.If the allocation fails, one of the necessary conditions to reproduce the NULL-Pointer dereference will be reached. There was a misunderstanding here about the vulnerability, because according to the PoC released by Laurent Gaffi\u00e9, the problem WASN'T in the structure pointer, but rather in one field of the CRITICAL_SECTION object pointed by this structure, which is NULL when the huge allocation fails !

Although the bug is triggered when a memory allocation fails, that doesn't mean that the allocation has to be giant, but rather that the LSASS service doesn't have enough available memory to allocate. I had been able to confirm that this vulnerability can be triggered in Windows 7 and 2008 R2 by establishing several SMB connections and sending evil sizes with values like 0x1000000 (16 MB). The problem is that in the case of the latest Windows versions, it's not possible to use this kind of sizes, because as I said before, the limit is 64KB. So, the only way to trigger this vulnerability should be by producing a memory exhaustion in the LSASS service. It may be possible to do so by finding a controllable malloc in the LSASS authentication process, creating multiple connections and producing a memory exhaustion until the \"LsapAllocateLsaHeap\" function fails. Maybe, this memory exhaustion condition could be easily reached in local scenarios. I realized that the fix wasn't working when I tried to understand why the public PoC wasn't working against Windows 10. It's surprising to see that nobody else noticed that \u2013that we know of-, and that a considerable amount\u00a0of Windows users have been unprotected for more than\u00a02 months since the public exploit was released. As of January 10th, Microsoft decided to release\u00a0a new security bulletin including\u00a0a patch for the affected systems (MS17-004). If we diff against the latest \"lsasrv.dll\" version (v6.1.7601.23642), we can see that the vulnerability was fixed by changing the\u00a0\"NegGetExpectedBufferLength\" function. Basically, the same 64KB packet size check used by Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 was now added to the rest of the Windows versions[/INST]\n\nTrigger: confirm, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The vulnerability, CVE-2017-5638, allows an attacker to execute commands on the server via content uploaded to the Jakarta Multipart parser component, deployed in some Struts installations. According to cyber-security firms F5, attacks started as soon as Cisco Talos researchers revealed the zero-day's presence and several proof-of-concept exploits were published online. F5 experts say that in the beginning, attackers targeted Struts instances running on Linux servers, where they would end up installing the PowerBot malware, an IRC-controlled DDoS bot also known as PerlBot or Shellbot. In later attacks, some groups switched to installing a cryptocurrency miner called \"minerd\" that mined for the Monero cryptocurrency. In other attacks reported by the SANS Technology Institute, some attackers installed Perl backdoors. Both SANS and F5 experts report that after March 20, one of these groups switched to targeting Struts instances installed on Windows systems. Using a slightly modified exploit code, attackers executed various shell commands to run the BITSAdmin utility and then downloaded (via Windows' built-in FTP support) the Cerber ransomware. From this point on, Cerber took over, encrypted files, and displayed its standard ransom note, leaving victims no choice but pay the ransom demand or recover data from backups. \"The attackers running this [Cerber] campaign are using the same Bitcoin ID for a number of campaigns,\" the F5 team said. \"This particular account has processed 84 bitcoins [~$100,000].\" F5 experts also noted that, on average, roughly 2.2 Bitcoin (~$2,600) go in and out of this particular wallet on a daily basis. It is worth mentioning that F5 published their findings last week, on March 29. Today, SANS detailed similar findings, meaning the campaign spreading Cerber ransomware via Struts on Windows is still going strong. Some of the initial attacks on Struts-based applications have been tracked by cyber-security firm AlienVault[/INST]\n\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: immediately fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were published online, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: say, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: pay the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

But the straight-shooting chief executive of Insurance Australia Group, Peter Harmer, did not dodge the question when asked what his firm had found while trawling through the \"dark web\". He said IAG had uncovered the personal details of customers belonging to one of the big four banks. The information was being sold online for $25 per customer. That suggests the systems of at least one major financial institution have been breached and customer data stolen. Harmer was primed for this conversation about cyber risks at the Summit. On Wednesday he had led the IAG board of directors on a tour of the company's cyber-security facility in Sydney. He said any chief executive who believes they have a secure digital environment is \"completely oblivious to the threats that are out there\". \"We trawl our systems all the time looking for unusual activity,\" he said. \"We trawl the dark net looking for where our data might be up for sale, and it's amazing when you actually see what is being offered for sale. All we've found is a couple of our employees' names and addresses, so our view is that we are reasonably confident with the analysis, and being able to thwart the hackers coming into our system.\" Harmer's most worrying revelation was that the global capacity for cyber protection was a measly $500 million. He said for a business such as IAG, which has a market capitalisation of $14 billion, this amount of insurance \"would not even touch the sides\". This made it imperative for companies to invest in defence efforts and avoid any major extraction of data by cyber attackers.

According to US-based cyber security firm FireEye, banking network frauds have spread around the world. The firm has tracked such incidents that affected banks in Ukraine, Ecuador and India, with losses totalling more than $100 million. \u201cIn India, we have seen financially-motivated cyber-criminal groups launching sophisticated attacks to steal funds from many potential sources: organisations, consumers, ATMs and banks. \u201cAs India\u2019s digital payment systems handle more transactions, they will become more lucrative targets,\u201d Vishal Raman, India Head at FireEye told BusinessLine. \u201cWe have found mobile apps of seven large banks in India infected with malware that has the capability to steal user credentials. We have informed the banks about the same,\u201d Raman said, without disclosing the names of the banks to prevent misuse of the vulnerabilities. Raman said that while the security deployed by banks in India has improved over the years, hackers seem to be moving faster and banks are merely playing catch-up. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a much higher degree of sophistication from attackers than ever before. Nation-states continue to set a high bar for sophisticated cyber attacks, but some financial threat actors have caught up. Financial attackers have improved their tactics, techniques and procedures to the point where they have become difficult to detect and challenging to investigate and remediate,\u201d he said. According to FireEye, a majority of both victim organisations and those working diligently on defensive improvements are still lacking fundamental security controls and capabilities to either prevent breaches or to minimise the damages and consequences of an inevitable compromise. The two major malware found on Indian banking apps by FireEye are: Webinjects and Bugat. Webinjects are a functionality integrated into many types of credential theft malware that allow hackers to dynamically alter what is displayed to victims on an infected device (mobile phone). In some cases a message is displayed that encourages users to download a malicious application, under the guise of installing a personal security certificate for their cell phone SIM card. Bugat is a credential theft malware used by a limited number of cyber-crime groups.

According to Safaricom, the hackers attempted to gain access to its system with an intention of gaining access to customer funds on its mobile money transfer platform M-Pesa. The telecom termed the breach as an elaborate cyber crime fraud attempt. Safaricom chief executive officer Bob Collymore said the firm\u2019s risk management unit detected the intrusion and immediately escalated the incident to the security agencies. The Safaricom boss however sought to assure customers that there was no cause for worry as no money had been lost. \u201cThis matter is being treated with the seriousness it deserves with the suspects due to be arraigned in court. I wish assure our customers that all their data is safe and we have no evidence of any money being removed from the system,\u201d Mr Collymore said in a statement to newsrooms. One method used by the hackers to access customer information was through a SIM swap that gives the fraudster access to a customer\u2019s SIM card. In the reported case, they managed to access Sh266,000 from one customer. Safaricom however says the funds were refunded once the breach was detected. M-Pesa is the largest mobile money transfer system in the country and has also been linked to several banks. Safaricom has partnered with the KCB Group and the Commercial Bank of Africa (CBA) to create mobile accounts that enable customers to deposit, transfer and request loans. In March, authorities discovered a cybercrime syndicated that had infiltrated the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) several blue chip companies as well as a supermarket chain. In the case of KRA, some Sh4 billion was said to be at risk from the cyber attack.

Unlike most document-related vulnerabilities, this zero-day bug that has yet to be patched doesn't rely on macros -- in which Office typically warns users of risks when opening macro-enabled files. Instead, the vulnerability is triggered when a victim opens a trick Word document, which downloads a malicious HTML application from a server, disguised to look like a Rich Text document file as a decoy. The HTML application meanwhile downloads and runs a malicious script that can be used to stealthily install malware. Researchers at McAfee, who first reported the discovery on Friday, said  because the HTML application is executable, the attacker can run code on the affected computer while evading memory-based mitigations designed to prevent these kinds of attacks. The issue relates to the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) function, which allows an application to link and embed content to other documents, according to researchers. The Windows OLE feature is used primarily in Office and Windows' in-built document viewer WordPad, but has been the cause of numerous vulnerabilities over the past few years. The researchers recently focused a Black Hat talk on the Windows OLE attack surface. The bug can be exploited on all versions of Office, including the latest Office 2016 running on Windows 10, and have spotted attacks in the wild since January.

McAfee researchers, who disclosed the zero-day's presence, say they've detected attacks leveraging this unpatched vulnerability going back to January this year. Attacks with this zero-day follow a simple scenario, and start with an adversary emailing a victim a Microsoft Word document. The Word document contains a booby-trapped OLE2link object. If the victim uses Office Protected View when opening files, the exploit is disabled and won't execute. If the user has disabled Protected View, the exploit executes automatically, making an HTTP request to the attacker's server, from where it downloads an HTA (HTML application) file, disguised as an RTF. The HTA file is executed automatically, launching exploit code to take over the user's machine, closing the weaponized Word file, and displaying a decoy document instead. According to FireEye, \"the original winword.exe process is terminated in order to hide a user prompt generated by the OLE2link.\" While the attack uses Word documents, OLE2link objects can also be embedded in other Office suite applications, such as Excel and PowerPoint. McAfee experts say the vulnerability affects all current Office versions on all Windows operating systems. The attack routine does not rely on enabling macros, so if you don't see a warning for macro-laced documents, that doesn't mean the document is safe.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: deliver, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: say, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: detected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disguised as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: say, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The flaw came to light last year, after a report from security researcher Rotem Kerner. His investigation discovered that this flaw was present in the firmware of DVRs manufactured by Chinese company TVT. Unfortunately, this wasn't any DVR manufacturer, but a seller of white-label products, meaning other vendors purchased the DVRs from TVT, slapped their logo on top, and sold them to their own customers as separate products. In total, Kerner tracked the sloppy-coded DVR firmware to 70 other DVR vendors. Despite numerous contact attempts, Kerner was unable to get in contact with the company, meaning the vulnerability remained unpatched. With exploit code publicly available, it didn't take long for attackers to target TVT-based DVRs. This was easy because all they had to do was to ping random IPs and listen to a server response for the terms \"Cross Web Server.\" During the past year, TVT DVRs have been at the heart of many IoT DDoS botnets. The first big botnet made up of TVT devices was discovered by Sucuri in June 2016, consisted of over 25,000 bots, and was used to launch Layer 7 DDoS attacks of up to 50,000 requests per second. While TVT devices were regularly targeted by various IoT malware families, the vendor's name came back into news headlines during the fall of 2016, when the Mirai botnet also incorporated these DVRs into its botnet. Now, according to a report published yesterday by cyber-security firm Palo Alto Networks, TVT devices are yet again targeted by another IoT malware that's building a huge botnet for launching DDoS attacks. Nicknamed Amnesia, this new malware strain is based on an older version of the Tsunami IoT/Linux DDoS botnet malware. This new Tsunami alteration is particularly advanced because this appears to be the first version of IoT malware that includes sandbox detection features, usually found in Android and Windows malware. This self-protection feature allows the malware to detect when security experts or security products execute the malware inside a virtual machine.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was present in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: remained unpatched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

According to The Guardian, the company became aware of a problem last week but only realized on Friday that data could be accessed externally, and only started contacting affected customers on Saturday. The U.K.\u2019s data protection regulator, the ICO, has apparently been informed of the breach \u2014 although it\u2019s unclear when. An ICO spokesperson did not\u00a0respond to the question, providing this statement instead: \u201cAll organisations have a responsibility to keep customers\u2019 personal information secure.

The report further cautions that a slight mistake could cause great cash loss to the financial institutions like what happened to a Bangladesh Bank Central Bank. The Sophos report indicates that financial infrastructure is at greater risk of attack. \"The use of targeted phishing and 'whaling' continues to grow. These attacks use detailed information about company executives to trick employees into paying fraudsters or compromising accounts. \"We also expect more attacks on critical financial infrastructure, such as the attack involving SWIFTconnected institutions which cost the Bangladesh Central Bank $81 million in February,\" reveals the report. The caution comes in following a Cybersecurity giant Sophos report published recently shows that the attacks are expected to increase this year. Expounding further, the report indi - cates that the year 2016 saw a huge number and variety of cyber-attacks, ranging from a high-profile DDoS using hijacked Internet-facing security cameras to the alleged hacking of party officials during the US election, according to a report by a Cybersecurity giant Sophos. The Sophos report shows that they also saw a rising tide of data breaches from big organisations and small and significant losses of people's personal information. \"Since the year 2016 is over, we're pondering how some of those trends might play out in 2017,\" it notes. The report indicates that the current and emerging attack trends include the destructive DDoS IOT attack which is expected to rise. \"In 2016, Mirai showed the massive destructive potential of DDoS attacks as a result of insecure consumer IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Mirai's attacks exploited only a small number of devices and vulnerabilities and used basic password guessing techniques,\" part of the report indicates. However, the report claims that cybercriminals will find it easy to extend their reach because there are so many IoT devices containing outdated code based on poorly-maintained operating systems and applications with well-known vulnerabilities. \"Expect IoT exploits, better password guessing and more compromised IoT devices being used for DDoS or perhaps to target other devices in your network,\" it notes.

The vulnerability affects TP-Link model M5350, a 3G mobile Wi-Fi router, often distributed by mobile telco providers to their customers, along with a SIM card they insert in the router. This SIM card allows the router to connect to the mobile operator's network, and just like any SIM card, has its own telephone number. In an online conversation with Bleeping Computer, H\u00f6rsch, who's a researcher for German cyber-security firm Securai, says that after he analyzed the router's firmware, he discovered a vulnerability in the feature that handles incoming SMS messages. By sending the following SMS, the router would answer back with the admin account password, the Wi-Fi network SSID, and the Wi-Fi network's password. The issue isn't as dangerous as it sounds, mainly because the attacker needs to know the router SIM card's phone number in order to exploit it, H\u00f6rsch told Bleeping Computer. This issue is one of many the researcher discovered in recent months in various devices. His findings were summarized and presented in a talk at the recently concluded Kaspersky Security Analyst Summit (SAS), held last week. In the same talk, H\u00f6rsch also presented several other vulnerabilities that allowed him to obtain root access to Hootoo Travelmate and Trendnet TEW714TRU routers and Vstarcam webcams. Other vulnerabilities the researcher discovered and presented at SAS include the presence of a hardcoded Telnet password in Startech modems, and a very simple to exploit authentication bypass for Panasonic BM ET200 retina scanners, which allowed anyone access to the admin panel just by deleting a few parameters in an URL.

Tens of millions of electronic health records have been compromised in recent years, a number that is growing and, some say, underreported. High-profile attacks have hit hospitals and health insurers, and now attention is turning to a new vulnerability: medical devices like pacemakers and insulin pumps. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has become increasingly concerned about the issue and is working to coordinate with other agencies on how to respond if a serious medical device hack were to occur. There have been rumblings over cybersecurity for years. More than 113 million personal health records were compromised in 2015, according to provider data reported to the Department of Health and Human Services (DHS), nine times as many as in 2014. Last fall, Johnson & Johnson had to tell its customers that its insulin pumps had a security vulnerability that hackers could use to access the device and cause a potentially fatal overdose of insulin. \"In just the last few years, we've seen more than a hundred million health records of American citizens breached in a couple of well-publicized incidents,\" Terry Rice, vice president of IT risk management and chief information security officer at Merck & Company, told the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee last week.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have been compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: had to tell, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: breached, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The figures come from NHS Digital, which oversees cyber security, and show an increase on 16 attacks in 2015. NHS Digital said the figures showed a \"rise in reporting, not necessarily a rise in cyber attacks\". But Oliver Farnan, from the Oxford Cyber Security Centre, said ransomware attacks had become more common. 'The risk is going to increase' Ransomware is software that locks computer systems and then demands a ransom to unlock the data. Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (OUH) repelled five ransomware attacks in 2016. \"That is something a number of hospitals have seen and is potentially quite worrying,\" said Dr Chris Bunch from OUH. He added: \"Across the health service we are still to a very large extent paper-based... and as we move increasingly towards digital records the risk is going to increase.\" Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust reported four ransomware attacks in 2016, and University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust and Kings College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust sustained three ransomware attacks each last year. No patient data was lost in any of the attacks on the trusts and a spokesperson for Kings College Hospitals Trust said it had a cyber security response plan that it continually reviewed and monitored. Oliver Farnan from the Oxford Cyber Security Centre, said it was hard to know if enough money was being spent on security in the NHS. \"Money is only really spent on security once everything else is up and running and in place... it always comes second,\" he said. But David Emm, principal security researcher at internet security firm Kaspersky Lab, said basic steps such as backing up data could make a difference. \"Ransomware is a very blunt instrument, if you have a back-up of data then you are not in a position where people can extort money in that way,\" he said. However, Mr Emm said public bodies faced specific challenges, and added that money was an issue. \"They have lots of people accessing the systems, there is lots of data moving in and out of the organisation, that does actually make it harder to secure that information,\" he said.

SecurityWeek detailed how the flaws affect an application from 3S-Smart Software Solutions. The potential problem for ICS security stems from CODESYS, a hardware-independent middleware layer for programming Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and ICS.  SecurityWeek reported the issue has now been resolved by 3S-Smart Software Solutions. However, the need for a patch, which could take some time to roll out to all affected organizations, highlighted the need for IT managers to be aware of the risk to connected technologies, particularly when it comes to ICS security.  The flaws were discovered by security firm CyberX. Phil Neray, vice president of industrial cybersecurity and marketing at CyberX, described how the vulnerabilities affect all devices incorporating CODESYS Web Server v2.3 and earlier versions of the software.  CODESYS is used to program a range of devices, such as programmable logic controllers and human machine interfaces. CyberX detailed how these devices are used in almost all elements of critical industrial infrastructure, including power plants, oil and gas installations, and chemical and pharmaceutical factories.  The first vulnerability, CVE-2017-6027, allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files to the CODESYS Web Server and potentially create remote code execution. The second flaw, CVE-2017-6025, is a stack-based buffer overflow that attackers could use to crash the application or execute arbitrary code.  The fear is that attackers could use the flaws to create safety failure and environmental damage at critical industrial infrastructure. ICS-CERT published an advisory note and rated the potential risk score of the vulnerabilities as critical because attackers can potentially gain remote code execution capabilities.  3S-Smart Software has released a patch, but CyberX suggested that the rollout process could be complicated by a range of factors.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: detailed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affect, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has now been resolved, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: roll out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: described, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affect, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The flaw was actually found in Broadcom\u2019s UPnP implementation used in popular routers, and ultimately the researchers extended the list of vulnerable routers to encompass devices manufactured by the likes of ASUS, D-Link, Zyxel, US Robotics, TP-Link, Netgear, and others. \u201cBack in the days, Cisco fixed the vulnerability, but we are not sure about all other router vendors and models because there are too many of them,\u201d the DefenseCode team noted.  When DefenseCode first came out with the vulnerability in 2013, Rapid7 researchers also found a number of flaws in other popular UPnP implementations, and by scanning the Internet, revealed that there were approximately 15 million devices with a vulnerable Broadcom UPnP implementation. It\u2019s difficult to tell how many of these devices are still vulnerable but, as DefenseCode\u2019s Leon Juranic pointed out to me, users rarely (if ever) update their router\u2019s firmware, so there are bound to be still many of them. And given how many people have watched and analyzed their technical video of the exploit in action over the years, obviously many are interested in it. Still, I think we can all agree, four years is more than enough time for patching, and nobody can fault them for publishing the exploit. Hopefully, if there are manufacturers that still haven\u2019t pushed out a patch they\u2019ll do it now, but this is could also be a welcome impetus for users to update their router\u2019s firmware \u2013 especially those that haven\u2019t done it for years.

In the first stage of the scam, you receive a phishing email disguised as a LinkedIn email. Here are just a few of the giveaways that this is a phishing email: Clicking either of the two links in the spam email will send you to https://linkedinjobs (dot ) jimdo (dot) com. We scanned the link with\u00a0VirusTotal, and most of the security solutions found it to be clean, with the exception of a less well known scanner, AutoShun. Clicking on the website itself will take you to a simple page, where the main focus falls on a form for uploading your CV. Your CV contains a wealth of personal data which a cybercriminal uses to make a profit at your expense. Phone numbers can be sold for companies doing promotional cold calling. Or, the cybercriminal might call you himself in a\u00a0vishing\u00a0attack. Sometimes however, the attacker targets a company you worked at (or a future company you want to work for). Using the information found within your CV, the attacker might impersonate you in order to launch spear phishing emails against people in those companies, such as the CEO or the accounting department, in order to illegally obtain\u00a0funds or money transfers. In 2016 for instance, the CEO of an Austrian airplane component manufacturer\u00a0was fired after he got tricked\u00a0by a spear phishing attack that led him to transfer around 40 million euros to the scammer\u2019s account. This isn\u2019t the first time LinkedIn has been used a cover for a phishing campaign. Another\u00a0similar situation was encountered in 2016, which we also covered. It\u2019s difficult (if not impossible) for companies alone to prevent these scams from taking place. In these cases, users too should contribute to keeping the Internet safe. In cases involving LinkedIn, the best course of action is to report these to the company: LinkedIn itself also offers a\u00a0thorough set of tips and advice\u00a0on how to recognize various scams over the network, such as inheritance or dating scams.

The BBC understands the government has investigated the previously unreported attack that began in April last year. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre would not say whether data was stolen. But a source told the BBC that the most sensitive Foreign Office information is not kept on the systems targeted by the hackers. Research published on Thursday by cybersecurity firm F-Secure suggested the attack was a \"spear-phishing\" campaign, in which people were sent targeted emails in attempts to fool them into clicking a rogue link or handing over their username and password. To do this, the attackers created a number of web addresses designed to resemble legitimate Foreign Office websites, including those used for accessing webmail.   F-Secure does not know whether the attack was successful. The company says the domains were created by hackers that it calls the Callisto Group, which it says is still active. However the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) declined to say who was behind the attack on the Foreign Office. The targeted emails that were sent out tried to fool targets into downloading malware which was first developed for law enforcement by the Italian software company Hacking Team.  Hacking Team's surveillance tools were previously exposed in a cyberattack, first reported in 2015.  There is no suggestion that Hacking Team had any involvement in the attacks. F-Secure said that the use of the software should remind governments that they \"don't have monopolies on these [surveillance] technologies\", and that once created the software can fall into the hands of hackers. The BBC has not seen evidence conclusively identifying the origin of the attack. A cybersecurity expert at another company, who wished to remain anonymous, found a link to information uncovered in the investigation of Russian efforts to influence the US election. Two of the phishing domains used by the hackers were once linked to an IP address mentioned in a US government report into Grizzly Steppe. Grizzly Steppe is the name given by the US government to efforts by \"Russian civilian and military intelligence services to compromise and exploit networks and endpoints associated with the US election\".[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: a \"spear-phishing\" campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: fool, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: designed to resemble, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were sent out, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: fool, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

According to research firm F-Secure, Callisto Group is an advanced threat actor whose known targets include military personnel, government officials, think tanks and journalists, especially in Europe and the South Caucasus. Their primary interest appears to be gathering intelligence related to foreign and security policy in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, and this, combined with infrastructure footprint links to known state actors, suggests a nation-state benefactor, the firm said. In October 2015 the Callisto Group targeted a handful of individuals with phishing emails that attempted to obtain the target\u2019s webmail credentials. Then, in early 2016, the Callisto Group began sending highly targeted spear phishing emails with malicious attachments that contained, as their final payload, the \u201cScout\u201d malware tool from the HackingTeam RCS Galileo platform. Scout was, ironically, originally developed for law enforcement. \u201cThese spear-phishing emails were crafted to appear highly convincing, including being sent from legitimate email accounts suspected to have been previously compromised by the Callisto Group via credential phishing,\u201d F-Secure noted in a paper, adding that the group is continuing to set up new phishing infrastructure every week. One of the targets for Callisto in 2016 was the Foreign Office, according to BBC sources. The outlet reports that the government is investigating an attack that began in April last year. A source told the BBC that the compromised server didn\u2019t contain the most sensitive information, fortunately. In a statement, the UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) declined attribution or comment and merely said: \"The first duty of government is to safeguard the nation and as the technical authority on cybersecurity, the NCSC is delivering ground breaking innovations to make the UK the toughest online target in the world.

This twisted tale starts in July 2016, when security researcher Ryan Hanson discovered a flaw in RTF files that he could exploit to execute code on the underlying operating system. After finishing his research, Hanson submitted a write-up on the three bugs he found to Microsoft in October 2016, via the company's bug bounty program. Uncharacteristic to Microsoft, the company took almost six months to fix the three bugs discovered by Hanson, delivering patches for all three (CVE-2017-0106, CVE-2017-0199, and CVE-2017-0204) in April's Patch Tuesday. A few days before Microsoft patched the zero-day, news about it broke via blog posts from McAfee and FireEye, both companies revealing the zero-day was under active exploitation. Unfortunately, this long patching period gave others the time to discover the same flaw. While initially McAfee and FireEye restrained from revealing any details about the zero-day, now that a patch is available, several security firms are now sharing more behind-the-scenes details. According to FireEye, the zero-day first came on their radar on January 25, 2017, when they discovered a FinSpy module exploiting the flaw. While FireEye discovered only this campaign, the cyber-security firm believes Gamma Group made available this new Microsoft zero-day to all of its clients, meaning it was likely used in other countries where the company sold its \"lawful intercept\" spyware. Two months after this campaign, towards the end of March, FireEye says it detected the zero-day again, but this time used by a group of cyber-criminals spreading LatentBot, a sophisticated backdoor trojan, usually found in enterprise environments and used for economic espionage campaigns. This group apparently started a yard sale after McAfee and FireEye disclosed the zero-day in public. Fearing that a patch was coming, this group shared (most likely sold) the zero-day exploit with other crimeware groups.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: submitted a write-up, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: delivering, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discover, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: detected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was coming, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: shared, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The flaw was discovered by researchers from security consultancy DefenseCode and is located in a feature that retrieves preview images for videos hosted on Vimeo. Such videos can be added to product listings in Magento. The DefenseCode researchers determined that if the image URL points to a different file, for example a PHP script, Magento will download the file in order to validate it. If the file is not an image, the platform will return a \"Disallowed file type\" error, but won't actually remove it from the server. An attacker with access to exploit this flaw could achieve remote code execution by first tricking Magento to download an .htaccess configuration file that enables PHP execution inside the download directory and then downloading the malicious PHP file itself. Once on the server, the PHP script can act as a backdoor and can be accessed from an external location by pointing the browser to it. For example, attackers could use it to browse the server directories and read the database password from Magento's configuration file. This can expose customer information stored in the database, which in the case of online shops, can be very sensitive. The only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited directly because the video-linking functionality requires authentication. This means attackers need to have access to an account on the targeted website, but this can be a lower-privileged user and not necessarily an administrator. The authentication obstacle can also be easily overcome if the website doesn't have the \"Add Secret Key to URLs\" option turned on. This option is intended to prevent\u00a0cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and is enabled by default. CSRF is an attack technique that involves forcing a user\u2019s browser to perform an unauthorized request on a website when visiting a different one. \"The attack can be constructed as simple as <img src=\u2026 in an email or a public message board, which will automatically trigger the arbitrary file upload if a user is currently logged into Magento,\" the DefenseCode researchers said in an advisory. \"An attacker can also entice the user to open a CSRF link using social engineering.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is located in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

According to researchers, these flaws can be exploited via SMS messages. The reason appears to be that Aga management opted to use a GSM SIM module to control its devices, instead of the classic option of using a Wi-Fi module. This SMS-based management feature allows Aga users to turn ovens on or off from remote locations by sending an SMS to their device. In this scenario, an attacker would need a victim's oven SMS number, but Pen Test Partners researchers say the web-based administration panel contains flaws that allow attackers to scrape for all active SIM card numbers assigned to Aga ovens. There's no authentication involved with the SMS management commands, meaning anyone could send them, and mess around with people's \"smart\" ovens. Professional cooking ovens, like the Aga iTotal Control, need hours of warming before reaching optimal cooking temperatures. While attackers could annoy oven owners by turning their ovens off, Pen Test Partners say that an ill-intent miscreant could also turn all known Aga ovens on, and cause a spike in electric energy consumption within an area, albeit this could be an exaggerated claim, as there would need to be thousands of these devices laying around. Besides the non-authenticated SMS-based remote management feature, the research team also discovered other major problems with Aga's smart ovens. For starters, the Aga web administration panel doesn't use HTTPS and forces users to use a five-digit password, one that's incredibly easy to brute-force. Second, the Aga mobile app also works via HTTP, but even if developers used HTTPS, the app disables certificate validation on purpose, meaning attackers could use any SSL certificate to intercept traffic coming in and to the app. After spending two weeks attempting to alert the UK-based IoT manufacturer, Pen Test Researchers decided to go public with their findings yesterday.

But Microsoft says it has already issued patches for the majority of attacks, and the most recent fix came last month.  \"Most of the exploits that were disclosed fall into vulnerabilities that are already patched in our supported products,\" a blog post published Friday night by Microsoft reads.  Broadly, the exploits could have allowed a hacker to\u00a0compromise affected computers on a variety of Windows versions.  For example, the ERRATICGOPHER attack was addressed prior to the release of Windows Vista, and ETERNALCHAMPION was fixed with two other previously disclosed vulnerabilities, according to the blog post.  ETERNALBLUE, ETERNALROMANCE, and ETERNALSYNERGY were all patched on March 14, according to a Microsoft Security Bulletin.   Microsoft did not patch three other exploits, ENGLISHMANDENTIST, ESTEEMAUDIT, and EXPLODINGCAN, ostensibly because the attacks could not be reproduced on supported systems\u2014that is, modern versions of Windows that Microsoft still issues updates for. Microsoft says customers using Windows 7 or above are not at risk.  \"Customers still running prior versions of these products are encouraged to upgrade to a supported offering,\" the Microsoft blog post added.  Interestingly before the March 14 patch, vulnerabilities related to several ETERNAL exploits also affected Windows 10, according to the Microsoft Security Bulletin. But, again, a fully up to date copy of Windows 10 will not be vulnerable.  Originally, it was believed that many of these exploits were so-called zero-days; exploits that took advantage of vulnerabilities that Microsoft was not aware of. Security researchers verified that many of the exploits did work against Windows systems.  However, it turns out that at least one of the researchers did not test the exploits against a fully up to date Windows machine, and crucially, not on one that included the March 14 patch.  Matthew Hickey, otherwise known as Hacker Fantastic and the co-founder of British cybersecurity firm Hacker House, told Motherboard on Saturday he had used a \"clean install\" of Windows to test the attacks. Meaning that the machine didn't include the latest security fixes, and led to erroneous results.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has already issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: came, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are already patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: two other previously disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were all patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: did not patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: issues, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: verified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: didn't include, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

When bugs are unknown to the vendor, and still unpatched, they're called zero-days. That's their value: they will work no matter what, as there's no fix for them. Criminal hackers, as well as hackers working for governments, sometimes use zero-days, but it's rare for the same zero-day exploit to be used by both groups.  Somehow, however, that's what happened with that Microsoft Word zero-day. The exploit was used by government hackers, likely inside Russia, to target victims and infect them with the infamous FinFisher spyware since at least late January. The same exploit, according to security firm FireEye, was also used by a criminal gang spreading malware known as Latentbot in March.  To add even more mystery to the mix, it appears that multiple researchers independent of each other found the original bug on which the exploit was developed. When Microsoft patched it on Tuesday, it credited three researchers, as well as its own internal teams. That's not unheard of, but as a recent study pointed out, it's rare for different teams or researchers to find the same bug, something that's known as \"bug-collision.\"   Ryan Hanson, a security researcher, claimed in a tweet that he originally found it in July and disclosed it to Microsoft in October. Hanson did not respond to a request for comment, but Motherboard was able to confirm this timeline.   For some reason, however, Microsoft didn't patch it until this week. (For example, previous office bugs found by Google Project Zero got patched within 90 days.)  The company said in a statement that they heard of a \"small number\" of targeted attacks in the wild using the exploit \"approximately one month ago,\" and added that there were no widespread attacks until McAfee disclosed the bug publicly last Saturday.  \"This was a complex investigation that took time to thoroughly investigate and patch,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told Motherboard.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: are unknown, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: still unpatched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: claimed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: originally found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: got patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The news was explosive in the digital security community because the tools contained methods to hack computers running Windows, meaning millions of machines could be at risk.

They were panicked: This is really bad, in about an hour or so any attacker can download simple toolkit to hack into Microsoft based computers around the globe. \u2014 Hacker Fantastic (@hackerfantastic) April 14, 2017 But just hours later, Microsoft announced that many of the vulnerabilities were addressed in a security update released a month ago. \u201cToday, Microsoft triaged a large release of exploits made publicly available by Shadow Brokers,\u201d Philip Misner, a Microsoft executive in charge of security wrote in a blog post. \u201cOur engineers have investigated the disclosed exploits, and most of the exploits are already patched.\u201d Misner\u2019s post showed that three of nine vulnerabilities from the leak were fixed in a March 14 security update.

Before you know it, a scammer might have your full name, date of birth, work and home email addresses, work and home telephone numbers, and all manner of other personal information that could be abused by scammers. At the simplest level such data breaches could lead to a rise in targeted spam attacks, or scam phone calls. But it could also be a stepping stone to more damaging business email compromise (also often known as \u201cCEO fraud\u201d) which has resulted, in some cases, in companies losing tens of millions of dollars.

In the email, the site warns that users who registered an allrecipes.com account or logged on as a registered member of the site prior to June 2013 (yes, that's almost four years ago), may have had their email address and password stolen. Part of the email reads as follows: We recently determined that the email address and password typed into allrecipes.com by members when they created or logged into their accounts prior to June 2013 may have been intercepted by an unauthorized third party. Based on information available to us, we cannot determine with certainty who did this or how this occurred. Our best analysis is that email addresses and allrecipes.com passwords were intercepted during account registration or login by our members. To its credit, the site has advised affected users to change their Allrecipes password, and ensure that they are not using the same password anywhere else on the net: Out of an abundance of caution, we recommend that all members who registered or logged into allrecipes.com prior to June 2013 promptly change their password. We are taking other steps as well and will continue to work diligently to deter unauthorized activity. You should promptly change your password on allrecipes.com and on any other sites for which you use the same username and password.

A Russian-speaking user called DevBitox has been advertising the ransomware in underground forums, security firm Recorded Future said in a blog post on Tuesday. \u00a0 Karmen is what experts call\u00a0ransomware-as-a-service -- a particularly worrisome trend. Amateur hackers with little technical know-how can buy access to them, and in return, they\u2019ll receive a whole suite of web-based tools to develop their own ransomware attacks. In Karmen's case, it offers an easy-to-use dashboard interface. Buyers can modify the ransomware, view what machines they've infected, and see how much they\u2019ve earned. To spread ransomware, hackers will often rely on spam emails with an attachment or a link to a website that contains malicious coding. Once it infects a computer, the ransomware will then encrypt the files hosted inside. To release the files, victims will have to pay up, usually in bitcoin. DevBitox, one of the developers behind Karmen, has posted messages in various forums saying that Russian and English language versions of the ransomware-as-a-service are available. The dashboard to the Karmen ransomware-as-a-service. So far, the hacker has sold 20 copies of Karmen, according to Recorded Future, which noted that the first infections of the ransomware variant occurred as early as December in Germany and the U.S. The $175 fee is a one-time upfront payment, said Andrei Barysevich, a director at Recorded Future. \u201cThis lowers the barrier for other criminals to carry out ransomware attacks, and allows buyers to retain 100 percent of payments from their infected victims,\u201d he added. However, victims hit with the Karmen ransomware have recourse. That\u2019s because the malicious coding is derived from Hidden Tear, an open source ransomware project. Cybercriminals have been using Hidden Tear to build their own ransomware variants. However, security experts have been responding with free decryption tools designed to release computers of the infections.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have to pay up, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Super Mario Run is a mobile game that Nintendo first released on the iOS platform in September 2016, followed by the Android version on March 23, 2017. Mobile games have always proven to be attractive lures for cybercriminals to get users to download their malicious apps and potentially unwanted apps (PUAs). This is not the first time that the name of a popular game was abused; we\u2019ve discussed how the popularity of Pok\u00e9mon Go\u00a0was similarly abused. Based on feedback from the\u00a0Smart Protection Network\u2122, we saw more than 400 of these apps in the first three months in 2017 alone. In the same time frame, we saw 34 fake apps explicitly named \u201cSuper Mario Run\u201d\u2014it\u2019s a noteworthy trend, as we saw the first of these only in December 2016. In this post we\u2019ll discuss the behavior of a new credit card stealing variant named \u201cFobus\u201d (detected as ANDROIDOS_FOBUS.OPSF). Cybercriminals frequently take advantage of popular and hotly anticipated titles to push their own malicious apps. These are usually distributed via third-party app stores. Some users may utilize such app stores to download \u201cunreleased\u201d versions of legitimate apps, or to obtain apps for free. These apps are illegitimate in the first place, and the risks to end users\u00a0are quite high. We strongly advise that users download and install apps only from legitimate app stores such as Google Play or trusted third-party app store. In other cases, an attacker may even provide a fake app store that resembles Google Play. Alternately, a message supposedly from a friend sent via social media may lead to a malicious app. Disabling the\u00a0\u201cAllow installation of apps from unknown sources\u201d setting prevents apps inadvertently downloaded these ways from being installed. By default, this setting is set to off.

Zscaler ThreatLabz found that the app claimed to give users access to the latest Android software updates, but in fact was being used to spy on a user\u2019s exact geolocation, which could have been used for any number of malicious reasons. Despite clear red flags, millions downloaded it. \u201cThe app portrays itself as a \u2018System Update,\u2019\u201d the firm\u2019s researchers explained, in a blog. \u201cAfter reading the app reviews, it became clear that several users were misled by the app, thinking that it would provide them with latest Android release. Many users were unhappy with the app and conveyed their concerns.\u201d In addition to the negative reviews, there were other indicators that raised suspicions: The Google Play Store page for this particular app was showing blank screenshots, which is not common, and there was no proper description for the app. It also didn\u2019t mention that it would track the victim, nor that it would send location information to a third party. It said only, \u201cThis application updates and enables special location features.\u201d \u201cThere are many spyware variations present on the Google Play store, such as Cell Tracker, but the legitimate apps are explicit in their intentions, and have specific purposes for tracking a user\u2019s device,\u201d Zscaler researchers noted. As soon as the user tries to start up the app, it abruptly quits and hides itself from the main screen. From there, it sets up an Android service and broadcast receiver to fetch the user\u2019s last known location and set it up in Shared Preferences. An attacker could also set a location alert when victim\u2019s battery is running low. Interestingly, the code is a carbon copy of the location-stealing code in DroidJack, the remote access trojan. \u201cThere are many apps on the Google Play Store that act as a spyware; for example, those that spy on the SMS messages of one\u2019s spouse or fetch the location of children for concerned parents,\u201d researchers said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: claimed, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

It also disclosed new attacks from earlier this year that exposed names, contact information, email addresses and purchase histories, although  the retailer says it repelled most of the attacks. The dual notifications mark the latest problems for the company, which disclosed in early 2014 that its payment systems were infected with malware that stole 350,000 payment card details. Over the past few years, retailers such as Target, Home Depot and others have battled to keep their card payments systems malware-free (see Neiman Marcus Downsizes Breach Estimate).  The 2015 incident started around Dec 26. In a notification to California about a month later, the retailer said it was believed attackers cycled through login credentials that were likely obtained through other data breaches. A total of 5,200 accounts were accessed, and 70 of those accounts were used to make fraudulent purchases.  Although email addresses and passwords were not exposed, the original notification noted, access to the accounts would have revealed names, saved contact information, purchase histories and the last four digits of payment card numbers. The affected websites included other brands run by Neiman Marcus, including Bergdorf Goodman, Last Call, CUSP and Horchow.  According to its latest notification, however, Neiman Marcus Group now says full payment card numbers and expiration dates were exposed in the 2015 incident. The latest attack disclosed by Neiman Marcus Group, which occurred around Jan 17, mirrors the one from December 2015. It affects the websites of Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman, Last Call, CUSP, Horchow and a loyalty program called InCircle.  Again, the company believes that attackers recycled other stolen credentials in an attempt to see which ones still worked on its sites. It appears that some of the credentials did unlock accounts. The breach exposed names, contact information, email addresses, purchase histories and the last four digits of payment card numbers. It didn't specify the number of accounts affected.  The attackers were also able to access some InCircle gift card numbers, the company says.

The relationship between the company and the FSB, as the spy agency is known, has heightened fears among U.S. cyberintelligence officials that Moscow is stepping up covert efforts to infiltrate computer networks that control critical U.S. infrastructure such as oil and gas pipelines and transportation. The Russian company is taking steps to open a U.S. branch office as part of the intelligence-gathering, said officials familiar with reports of the effort who spoke on background. Officials familiar with reports about the company did not identify it by name.

Nintendo recently released\u00a0Super Mario Run for the iOS platform. In no time, the game became a sensational hit on the iTunes store. However, there is not yet an Android version and there has been no official news on such a release. Attackers are taking advantage of the game's popularity,\u00a0spreading malware posing as an Android version of Super Mario Run. The ThreatLabZ team wrote\u00a0about a similar scam that\u00a0occurred during the release of another wildly popular Niantic\u00a0game, Pokemon GO. Like that scam, the new Android Marcher Trojan is disguised as the Super Mario Run app and attempts to trick users\u00a0with fake finance apps and a credit card page in an effort to capture banking details. Once the user's mobile device has been infected, the malware waits for victims to open one of its targeted apps and then presents the fake overlay page asking for banking details. Unsuspecting victims will provide the details that will be harvested and sent out to to the malware's command and control (C&C) server. We have seen this malware evolve and take advantage of recent trends in order to target a large number of users. We have covered similar campaigns in the past related to Marcher malware here and here. Technical details In this new strain, the Marcher malware is disguised as the Super Mario Run app for Android.

Over the past decade, ambient light sensors have become quite common in smartphones, tablets, and laptops, where they are used to detect the level of surrounding light and automatically adjust a screen's intensity to optimize battery consumption... and other stuff. The sensors have become so prevalent, that the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed a special API that allows websites (through a browser) to interact with a device's ambient light sensors. Browsers such as Chrome and Firefox have already shipped versions of this API with their products. Last month, in a discussion of the W3C Generic Sensor specification, the Google team proposed that ambient light sensors (ALS), together with gyroscope, magnetometer, and accelerometer sensors, should be exempt from the browser permissions system. In other words, websites using these sensors won't have to ask users for explicit permission before accessing the any of these four sensors. Google's opinion is that by removing this permission requirement, browsers will be on par with mobile applications, which also don't have to ask the user for permission before accessing these sensors. This proposal didn't go well with Olejnik and fellow researcher Artur Janc, who in a series of demos, have proved that light radiating from the device's screen, is often picked up by the ambient light sensors. A determined attacker that can lure victims to his site, or one that can insert malicious code on another site, can determine which URLs a user has visited in the past. The whole attack relies on using different colors for normal and previously visited links, which produce a small light variation that ambient light sensors can pick up. Furthermore, Olejnik and Janc also proved that ambient light sensors can steal QR codes, albeit this attack takes longer to perform. Right now, ambient light sensors readings are blocked in Chrome behind settings flags, as the API is experimental, but they're supported in Firefox via DeviceLight events. According to Olejnik, mitigating this attack is simple, as it only requires browser makers and the W3C to adjust the default frequency at which the sensors report their readings.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: can steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Both attacks Olejnik and Janc devised take from seconds to minutes to execute. With these mitigations in place, the attacks wouldn't be stopped, but they would take even longer to perform, making any of them impractical in the real world. In the long run, Olejnik and Janc hope to see access to these sensors behind a dedicated browser permission. The two researchers filed bug reports with both Chrome and Firefox in the hopes their recommendations will be followed. Olejnik has previously showed how battery readouts can allow advertisers to track users online, how the new W3C Web Bluetooth API is riddled with privacy holes, and how the new W3C Proximity Sensor API allows websites and advertisers to query the position of nearby objects.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: filed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The botnet, which flip-flops from sending penny stock pump-and-dump emails to booby-trapped files that lead to malware (usually Locky or Dridex), has been spotted slinging thousand upon thousand of emails in the last three or four days. \u201cTalos has seen in excess of 35K emails in the last several hours associated with this newest wave of Locky,\u201d Cisco Talos researchers noted on Friday.  In the first part of the spam campaign, the emails contain no text except in the Subject line, which simply says \u201cReceipt\u201d or \u201cPayment\u201d, followed by random numbers. Those numbers are seen again in the name of the attached PDF file (as seen in the screenshot above). Later, the emails were made to look like they contained a scanned image in PDF format for the recipient to peruse. In both cases, the attached PDF contains embedded Word documents with macros, and in order for them to be opened and run the aforementioned macros, users are required to enable them. This is achieved through subterfuge: the victims are shown a note saying that the document is protected, and that they have to \u201cEnable editing\u201d in order to view it. Before that, the victims are also prompted to allow the opening of the file \u2013 a step that\u2019s required for the malware to bypass the protection offered by the program\u2019s sandbox. \u201cThe word document itself contains an XOR\u2019d Macro that downloaded the Locky sample from what is likely a compromised website,\u201d the researchers explained, noting that the DNS requests associated with the domain serving the malware have been spiking, but that it\u2019s difficult to determine if these requests are from victims or the many security practitioners that are investigating this widespread campaign. Users who go through through all the motions required to serve the malware will end up with their files encrypted and the .osiris extension added to them.

The Shadow Brokers made news back in August when they dumped hacking tools for routers and firewall products that they claimed came from the Equation Group, a top cyberespionage team that some suspect works for the NSA. Those tools contained several previously unknown and valuable exploits, lending credibility to the hacking group's claims, according to security researchers. The Shadow Brokers' latest dump includes 61 files, many of which have never been seen by security firms before, said Jake Williams, founder of Rendition InfoSec, a security provider. He\u2019s been examining the tools, and said it\u2019ll take time to verify their capabilities. His initial view is that they\u2019re designed for detection evasion. For instance, one of the tools is built to edit Windows event logs. Potentially, a hacker could use the tool to selectively delete notifications and alerts in the event logs, preventing the victim from realizing they\u2019ve been breached, he said. \u201cIf you simply remove a record or two, then even an organization that is following the best security practices, presumably, wouldn\u2019t notice the change,\u201d he said. On Thursday, the Shadow Brokers said they released the Windows hacking tools for free because a Kaspersky Lab\u2019s antivirus product could already flag them as harmful. The clandestine group previously tried to auction off a whole set of hacking tools for 1 million bitcoins or what was at the time US$584 million. But after several months, that auction only managed to generate 10 bitcoins. \u201cDespite theories, it always being about bitcoins for TheShadowBrokers,\u201d the group said in broken English in their supposed final message. However, Williams believes the Shadow Brokers are likely spies working for the Russian government. This latest dump was a message to the U.S, he said. In recent weeks, U.S. intelligence agencies have been claiming the Kremlin tried to influence the U.S. election. Based on those findings, President Barack Obama has already ordered sanctions against Russia and vowed covert action. \u201cIf they are Russian, this is a shot across the bow,\u201d Williams said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: dumped, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: dumped, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: latest dump, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

In some cases, attackers may have accessed messages and content in chat rooms, HipChat said in a Monday blog post. But this happened in no more than 0.05 percent of the cases, each of which involved a domain URL, such as company.hipchat.com. HipChat didn't say how many users may have been affected by the incident. The passwords that may have been exposed would also be difficult to crack, the company said. The data is hashed, or obscured, with the bcrypt algorithm, which transforms the passwords into a set of random-looking characters. For added security, HipChat \"salted\" each password with a random value before hashing it. HipChat warned that chat room data including the room name and topic may have also been exposed. But no financial or credit information was taken, the company said. HipChat is a popular messaging service used among enterprises, and an attack that exposed sensitive work-related chats could cause significant harm.\u00a0 The service, which is owned by Atlassian, said it detected the security incident last weekend. It affected a server in the HipChat Cloud and was caused by a vulnerability in an unnamed, but popular, third-party library that HipChat.com used, the company said.\u00a0 No other Atlassian systems were affected, the company said. \u201cWe are confident we have isolated the affected systems and closed any unauthorized access,\u201d HipChat said in its blog post. This is not the first time the messaging service has faced problems keeping accounts secure. In 2015, HipChat reset user passwords after detecting and blocking suspicious activity in which account information was stolen from less than 2 percent of its users. When breaches occur, security experts advise users to change their passwords for any accounts where they used the same login information. Users can consider using a password manager to help them store complex, tough-to-memorize passwords.\u00a0 HipChat has already sent an email to affected users, informing them of the password reset. In 2015, rival chat application Slack reported its own breach, and as a result rolled out two-factor authentication to beef up its account security. HipChat does not offer two-factor authentication.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: have exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: have accessed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: have been exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: have also been exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was taken, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: an attack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The hacker who shared the data with LeakBase says the attack happened earlier this month. Headquartered in Shenzhen, China, R2Games operates a number of free-to-play, micropayment-driven games on iOS and Android, as well as modern browsers. The company currently supports 19 online games, and claims over 52 million players. In December of 2015, stretching into July of 2016, more than 22 million R2Games accounts were compromised, exposing IP addresses, easily cracked passwords, email addresses, and usernames. The company denied the breach reports, telling one customer that \"R2Games is safe and secured, and far from being hacked.\" The hacker claims all forums were compromised, in addition to the Russian version of r2games.com. The latest record set includes usernames, passwords, email addresses, IP addresses, and other optional record fields, such as instant messenger IDs, birthday, and Facebook related details (ID, name, access token). LeakBase shared the most recent records with Troy Hunt, a security researcher and owner of the non-profit breach notification website \"Have I Been Pwned?\" (HIBP). Hunt checked the data by testing a small sample of email addresses and usernames against the password reset function on R2Games. Every address checked was confirmed as an existing account. From there, Hunt did some number crunching. There were 5,191,898 unique email addresses in the data shared by LeakBase. However, 3,379,071 of those email addresses were using mail.ar.r2games.com or\u00a0mail.r2games.com; and another 789,361 looked generated, as they were all [number]@vk.com addresses. LeakBase speculates that the r2games.com addresses are the result of registrations from third-party services. After stripping the questionable addresses Hunt was left with 1,023,466 unique email addresses to load into HIBP.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has been compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: obtained, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the attack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: being hacked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

When asked about the passwords, Hunt told Salted Hash many of them are MD5 with no salt, but a large number of them have a hash corresponding to the password \"admin\" and a few hundred thousand others are using the plain text word \"sync\". \"The observation I'd make here is that clearly, they don't seem to be learning from previous failures. The prior incident should really have been a wake-up call and to see a subsequent breach not that long after is worrying. Perhaps the prior denials are evidence that they just don't see the seriousness in security,\" Hunt said, when asked his opinion about the latest R2Games data breach. Salted Hash reached out to R2Games, but the company didn't respond to questions. Emails were sent to support, as well as recruiting and sales, on the off chance someone could direct them to the proper resources. For their part, LeakBase said since this data breach isn't in the public domain, they will not add the records to their service and it will not be searchable. However, they do plan to email impacted users and inform them of the incident. HIBP has been updated, and those changes are live now. If you're an R2Games player, it might be wise to change your password and make sure the old password isn't used on any other websites. Also, keep an eye out for gaming related offers and emails, as well as \"notifications\" from domains that aren't related to R2Games itself - as those could be scammers looking to cash-in on the breach. While the hacked data isn't public yet, there's nothing preventing the person who shared it with LeakBase from selling it or trading it.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: this data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

As you might remember, the service was hacked in 2015, and the attackers stole sensitive personal and financial data of 37 million users, and later dumped it online.  Since then, cyber criminals have been attempting to monetize this data by sending emails to users whose info they found in the dump, threatening to reveal all of it to the target\u2019s nearest and dearest, and asking for money in exchange for silence. The emails generally contain some of the target\u2019s personal data as to make the threat believable, and often claims that the attackers have found the target\u2019s Facebook account and, therefore, have the means to contact their friends, family, and employer. In this latest round of blackmail attempts, they are threatening to set up a site and publish all the stolen information. \u201cOn May 1 2017 we are launching our new site \u2013 Cheaters Gallery \u2013 exposing those who cheat and destroy families.

On Tuesday, Zimperium zLabs researchers published a blog post detailing the security flaws, two escalation of privilege bugs found within the NVIDIA Video driver and MSM Thermal driver. The Nvidia bug, CVE-2016-2435, impacts Android 6.0 on the Nexus 9 handset. The problem arises when attackers craft an application to tamper with read/write memory values and force privilege escalation. The second security flaw, CVE-2016-2411, involves a Qualcomm power management kernel driver, the MSM Thermal driver, in Android version 6. If an attacker crafts a malicious application, they can give themselves root access through an internal bug in the driver, leading to privilege escalation. These bugs are well documented, known, and for the most part security updates have been issued. However, Zimperium says that making the technical details available of these so-called \"N-day\" flaws is important and can act as a catalyst to boost the speed of patch production and to iron out problems arriving between a patch being created and vendors distributing the update in good time. In February, Zimperium launched an N-day acquisition program which is only interested in known security problems, rather than unknown and unpatched zero-days. Over the next year, the exploit purchaser is budgeting a total of $1.5 million to pick up the details on these exploits. Once a bug has been discovered and a fix is being worked on, an N-day exploit indicates a time of one or more days in which user systems can be compromised until a security update is issued. \"By focusing on N-days, or patched vulnerabilities, Zimperium is applying pressure on the mobile ecosystem to re-think how and when users receive security updates,\" the company said at the time. \"[The] program will reward the hard work of researchers who wouldn't otherwise receive compensation for an N-day exploit.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: impacting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: impacts, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: arises, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: involves, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are well documented, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: known, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: says, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: so-called, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: being created, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: distributing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: launched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is being worked on, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: is issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: receive, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Highlighting Russian \"malicious cyber activity\" the IC's analysis reported on this \"advanced persistent threat\" by confirming it was likely linked to the county's military or intelligence services. The hackers go by many names: Fancy Bear, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Sednit, Tsar Team and more. The group \u2013 after targeting the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) and the German government \u2013 is the focus of a new report from US-based cybersecurity firm FireEye, discussing the key hacking techniques it uses. \"We have observed APT28 rely on four key tactics when attempting to compromise intended targets,\" the report states. These include the use of spearphishing to deploy exploit kits, the spreading of malware, compromising web-facing servers and creating fake internet addresses. Some of the tactics are straightforward, but work. In one hypothetical case, a hacker would craft an exploit document with \"enticing lure content\" and send it to a carefully chosen victim. Once the document is opened, malware is automatically installed by exploiting a vulnerability in computer software. According to FireEye, APT28 has exploited a number of known security flaws in the past including previously undiscovered \"zero day\" vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash Player, Java, and Windows. The hackers then contact targets saying they need to reset passwords, lead the victim to a malicious login page and hijack passwords. \"APT28 employs a suite of malware with features indicative of the group's plans for continued operations, as well as the group's access to resources and skilled developers,\" the report states. After information is stolen, FireEye explains, the hacking group will often leak it to \"further political narratives\". These reportedly include the conflict in Syria, Nato, the European Union refugee crisis and the 2016 Olympics and Paralympics athlete doping scandal. In agreement with the US government, the security firm believes the hacking group conducts its operations \"in support of Russian strategic interests\" and is made up of a \"sophisticated and prolific set of developers and operators\".

Golunski reported it to SquirrelMail (sole) developer Paul Lesniewski, who asked for a delay of publication of the details until he could fix the flaw. But as Cavallarin published details about it last week (after not receiving any reply by the SquirrelMail developer), Golunski did the same during the weekend. Both researchers provided a proof-of-concept exploit for the flaw, and Cavallarin even offered an unofficial patch for plugging the hole. All this prompted Lesniewski to push out a patch on Monday, and new, patched version snapshots of the software (1.4.23-svn and 1.5.2-svn). He also told The Register that exploitation of the bug is difficult to pull off. \u201cIn order to exploit the bug, a malicious user would need to have already gained control over a mail account by other means, SquirrelMail would need to be configured to allow users to change their outgoing email address (we recommend keeping this disabled), the user would need to determine the location of the attachments directory (by gaining shell access or making guesses), the permissions on said directory and files would need to allow access by other processes (by default this will usually be the case, but prudent admins will exert more stringent access controls) and of course, SquirrelMail needs to be configured to send via Sendmail and not SMTP (default is SMTP),\u201d he explained.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: could fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: provided, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: offered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: plugging, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: push out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The collection of driver's license information surprised researchers, who haven't spotted such behavior in a PoS malware family until now. Even more surprising was that this new data collection system was spotted in an ancient PoS malware family, and not in one of the newer players. The name of this malware is RawPOS, a malware family that appeared way back in 2008. Typically, financial malware lives a few years, then it fizzles out and dies, as security firms learn to detect and stop it. In spite of its old age, RawPOS stuck around, and its operators continued to update and deploy it in attacks over the years. Like all other POS malware families, RawPOS is built to target and infect computers that run PoS software. On these PCs, the malware lies in hiding and keeps an eye on the data flowing through the computer's RAM. Using a simple regex string pattern, RawPOS scrapes the RAM until it finds data that fits the pattern. This pattern is specifically designed to detect payment card data, such as card numbers. Across the years, the different RawPOS versions have featured different versions of this regex string pattern. In total, security researchers have observed five different RawPOS patterns (versions). Earlier this year, Trend Micro discovered the sixth, which featured an expanded regex filter. Besides keeping an eye on credit card data, this expanded filter scraped the infected computer's RAM for the term \"driver's license\" and \"ANSI 636.\" While not directly evident for most, ANSI 636 is a barcode format used for the 2D barcode found on US drivers' licenses. Pharmacies, retail shops, bars, casinos and others establishments usually scan a customer's driver's license as authorization before making particular transactions, such as when buying drugs and alcohol. This data, just like payment card data, is handled and collected by some PoS software solutions, so it makes sense seeing this new regex string pattern inside RawPOS. Researchers believe crooks behind this malware are gathering this information to create more complete victim profiles, in order to aid various fraud operations, such as identity theft.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: The collection, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: this new data collection system, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: are gathering, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Motherboard has obtained 900 GB of data related to Cellebrite, one of the most popular companies in the mobile phone hacking industry. The cache includes customer information, databases, and a vast amount of technical data regarding Cellebrite's products. The breach is the latest chapter in a growing trend of hackers taking matters into their own hands, and stealing information from companies that specialize in surveillance or hacking technologies. Cellebrite is an Israeli company whose main product, a typically laptop-sized device called the Universal Forensic Extraction Device (UFED), can rip data from thousands of different models of mobile phones. That data can include SMS messages, emails, call logs, and much more, as long as the UFED user is in physical possession of the phone. Cellebrite is popular with US federal and state law enforcement, and, according to the hacked data, possibly also with authoritarian regimes such as Russia, the United Arab Emirates, and Turkey. The cache includes alleged usernames and passwords for logging into Cellebrite databases connected to the company's my.cellebrite domain. This section of the site is used by customers to, among other things, access new software versions. In the majority of cases, this was not possible because the email address was already in use. A customer included in the data confirmed some of their details. The dump also contains what appears to be evidence files from seized mobile phones, and logs from Cellebrite devices. According to the hacker, and judging by timestamps on some of the files, some of the data may have been pulled from Cellebrite servers last year. \"Cellebrite recently experienced unauthorized access to an external web server,\" the company said in a statement on Thursday after Motherboard informed it of the breach. \"The company is conducting an investigation to determine the extent of the breach. The impacted server included a legacy database backup of my.Cellebrite, the company's end user license management system.

The company behind the database is Alliance Direct Lending Corporation, according to Kromtech Security Research Center, which discovered the data earlier this week. It said the data was found on an unprotected Amazon server and that the data could have been exposed\u00a0for up to two years. According to Alliance Direct Lending\u2019s website, the company works with individuals and auto dealership partners to help car owners refinance existing auto loans. Data stored in the cloud was in clear text, according Diachenko. He said data also included several dozen recorded voice conversations with customers that disclosed full Social Security numbers of loan applicants. Sample data included the names of 114 car dealerships. According to Kromtech, it estimated between 550,000 to 1.1 million loan records from those dealers were exposed online. Dealers were located across the United States from California, Colorado, Florida and Massachusetts.  Kromtech said it was unsure if additional third parties may have accessed the data. Privacy experts said the data in the hands of the wrong person would be a nightmare for victims. A criminal that knows the data comes from people who have refinanced their car loan and may have less than stellar credit, coupled with partial Social Security numbers, would be a dream come true. \u201cThings could go wrong on a variety of levels. The data could be used to phish additional data via email or phone scams. That\u2019s not even mentioning the reputational damage to those in the database with bad credit scores,\u201d said Adam Levin, chairman and founder of CyberScout. The data found by Kromtech was on an Amazon\u2019s AWS S3 server. AWS S3 is marketed as an easy-to-use web service that allows businesses to store and retrieve data at a moment\u2019s notice.

Macron's party, known as \"En Marche!\" or \"Onwards\", said it had been hit by at least five advanced \"phishing\" attacks that involved trying to trick a broad number of campaign staff members to click on professionally-looking fake web pages. The latest attacks were confirmed by security firm Trend Micro , whose researchers found links to a cyber espionage group it has dubbed Pawn Storm, the Macron team noted. Other experts link the group, also known as \"Fancy Bear\" or \"APT 28\", to Russian military intelligence agency GRU. Russia has denied involvement in attacks on Macron's campaign. Macron, an independent centrist who has been critical of Russian foreign policy, faces far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France's presidential runoff on May 7. Le Pen has taken loans from Russian banks and has called for closer ties with Moscow.  \"Emmanuel Macron is the only candidate in the French presidential campaign to be targeted (in phishing attacks),\" his party said in a statement, adding this was \"no coincidence\". In mid-February, an En Marche! official told a news conference the party was enduring \"hundreds if not thousands\" of attacks on its networks, databases and sites from locations inside Russia and asked the French government for assistance. The Macron campaign said on Wednesday it had carried out counter-offensive actions against the fake web sites, which were designed to trick campaign workers into divulging their user credentials.

The attack against DHL Germany was particularly effective as it shut down the company's business customer portal and all APIs, prompting eBay Germany to issue an alert regarding possible issues with packages sent via DHL. \"They seem to know what to hit,\" said Daniel Smith, security researcher for Radware, and one of the persons currently keeping tabs of the attacks. The group sent emails to all the companies it targeted. In the emails, they didn't ask for a ransom to stop the attacks, but a fee for having already carried out what they called a DDoS protection test. Usually, these types of groups launch DDoS attacks and then send emails to their victims requesting for payments to stop the attacks. XMR Squad's emails looked like invoices for unrequested DDoS tests. Furthermore, the ransom note didn't include payment instructions, which is weird, to say the least. DDoS ransoms are usually handled in Bitcoin or another anonymous cryptocurrency. It was strange to see the group ask for payment in Euros, as the group's name included the term XMR, the shortname for Monero, an anonymous cryptocurrency. While the group advertised on Twitter that their location was in Russia, a German reporter who spoke with the group via telephone said \"the caller had a slight accent, but spoke perfect German.\" To the same reporter, the group also claimed they carried out the attacks only to get public attention. The attention they got wasn't the one they expected, as their hosting provider took down their website, located at xmr-squad.biz.

They are also notifying affected customers, and advising them to change their passwords. The confirmation comes a few hours after Motherboard released general information about 900 GB of data that they obtained and has supposedly been stolen from the firm. The cache includes alleged usernames and passwords for logging into Cellebrite databases connected to the company\u2019s my.cellebrite domain,\u201d the publication noted. \u201cThe dump also contains what appears to be evidence files from seized mobile phones, and logs from Cellebrite devices\u201d.

The bug was unusually dangerous but of a common genre: it was in Microsoft software, could allow a hacker to seize control of a personal computer with little trace, and was fixed April 11 in Microsoft\u2019s regular monthly security update.   But it had traveled a rocky, nine-month journey from discovery to resolution, which cyber security experts say is an unusually long time.   Google\u2019s security researchers, for example, give vendors just 90 days\u2019 warning before publishing flaws they find. Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) declined to say how long it usually takes to patch a flaw.   While Microsoft investigated, hackers found the flaw and manipulated the software to spy on unknown Russian speakers, possibly in Ukraine.   And a group of thieves used it to bolster their efforts to steal from millions of online bank accounts in Australia and other countries.   Those conclusions and other details emerged from interviews with researchers at cyber security firms who studied the events and analyzed versions of the attack code.   Microsoft confirmed the sequence of events.   The tale began last July, when Ryan Hanson, a 2010 Idaho State University graduate and consultant at boutique security firm Optiv Inc in Boise, found a weakness in the way that Microsoft Word processes documents from another format. That allowed him to insert a link to a malicious program that would take control of a computer.   The company often pays a modest bounty of a few thousands dollars for the identification of security risks.   Soon after that point six months ago, Microsoft could have fixed the problem, the company acknowledged. But it was not that simple. A quick change in the settings on Word by customers would do the trick, but if Microsoft notified customers about the bug and the recommended changes, it would also be telling hackers about how to break in.   Alternatively, Microsoft could have created a patch that would be distributed as part of its monthly software updates. But the company did not patch immediately and instead dug deeper. It was not aware that anyone was using Hanson\u2019s method, and it wanted to be sure it had a comprehensive solution.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: officially known as, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: 90 days\u2019 warning, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: publishing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: find, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: could have fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: acknowledged, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: notified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the recommended changes, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: could have created, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: would be distributed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: did not patch immediately, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The saga shows that Microsoft\u2019s progress on security issues, as well as that of the software industry as a whole, remains uneven in an era when the stakes are growing dramatically.   Finally, on the Tuesday, about six months after hearing from Hanson, Microsoft made the patch available. As always, some computer owners are lagging behind and have not installed it.   Ben-Gurion University employees in Israel were hacked, after the patch, by attackers linked to Iran who took over their email accounts and sent infected documents to their contacts at technology companies and medical professionals, said Michael Gorelik, vice president of cyber security firm Morphisec.   When Microsoft patched, it thanked Hanson, a FireEye researcher and its own staff.

March saw two rounds of serious flaws made public by Google\u2019s Tavis Ormandy (quickly fixed), which seemed like a lot for a single week. Days ago, news emerged of a new issue (also fixed) in the company\u2019s two-factor/two-step authentication (2FA) security. To coin a phrase, all serious flaws are serious \u2013 but some are more serious than others. This one matters for two reasons, only one of which will sound flippant: it wasn\u2019t discovered by Tavis Ormandy, who at times has seemed to be writing a novella on flaw-hunting with the company\u2019s name on it. Another researcher with a taste for LastPass, researcher Martin Vigo, uncovered the latest issue, and it\u2019s the 2FA bit of the story that explains the angst. Two-factor authentication (a term that also refers to more convenient but less secure two-step verification) matters because it is the crown jewels of everyday security, especially for password managers such as LastPass. The flaws are explained by Vigo in a slightly confusing way (one compromise was subsequently shown not to be exploitable) but cover overlapping weaknesses that might under specific circumstances allow 2FA to be bypassed when using Google\u2019s Authenticator and QR codes. Again a user being logged into LastPass at the time of an attack is entirely possible. Significantly, LastPass quickly stopped using the login hash (used to authenticate the master password without having to know it) to retrieve Authenticator\u2019s QR codes, and now sets a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token to plug another weakness. We still don\u2019t know why LastPass has been plagued by so many issues in such a short space of time \u2013 perhaps it\u2019s just a big-name target worth researching \u2013 but some of these weaknesses appear to be in its design, the result of decisions to do things in a certain way, probably some years in the past.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: made public, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: quickly fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: emerged, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: also fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: wasn\u2019t discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: uncovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are explained, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

It has been extensively amended (see endnotes) following a review by the Guardian\u2019s readers\u2019 editor. A design feature that could potentially allow some encrypted messages to reach unintended recipients is present within the WhatsApp messaging service. Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which has about one billion users, has not made it widely known that there is an aspect of WhatsApp that results in some messages being re-encrypted and resent automatically, without first giving the sender an opportunity to verify the recipient. Campaigners have expressed concern about how this aspect of WhatsApp could potentially be exploited to conduct surveillance. WhatsApp has made privacy and security a primary selling point, and has become a go-to communications tool of activists, dissidents and diplomats. Its end-to-end encryption relies on the generation of unique security keys using the acclaimed Signal protocol, developed by Open Whisper Systems. Keys are exchanged between users to guarantee communications are secure from interception by middlemen. The way WhatsApp implemented the protocol, new keys are generated when \u2013 for example \u2013 a user gets a new phone or reinstalls the app. Messages for the user which may have been waiting to be delivered while the user was offline are then re-encrypted and resent by the sender automatically, without the sender having had an opportunity to verify that the recipient is the person intended to receive the message. A sender is notified after the event if the sender has opted to turn on a notification in settings, but not otherwise. This aspect of WhatsApp, which increases convenience and reliability of message delivery at the cost of some security, is not inherent to the Signal protocol. If a recipient\u2019s security key changes while offline, an in-transit message will fail to be delivered and the sender will be notified of the change in security keys without the message having been resent automatically.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: is present, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have expressed concern, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Due to this, WhatsApp would be able to intercept the key exchange and - of course - would be able to intercept the messages. This is how a man-in-the-middle attack works and it only works when both parties - which are communicating with each other - do not verify the fingerprints of the exchanged keys. Signal and WhatsApp are using a concept called \u201cTOFU\u201d or \u201cTrust on first use\u201d. This means, that when a key is exchanged, this key is trusted as long as the key does not change. Signal and WhatsApp have different default settings what happens, when the key-material of a contact changes: WhatsApp just notifies the user when key material changes. Signal blocks outgoing messages and does not send new messages to a user where the key material has changed. A Signal user has to manually verify the new key by default (in this case, a user should verify the key material in person by scanning the QR code of the fingerprint).[/INST]\n\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Essentially, if an attacker can reroute a redelivered encrypted message, it is possible to decrypt the text. Facebook-owned WhatsApp stresses this is not a serious flaw nor a deliberate backdoor in its code. Users can detect and stop the surveillance, if it happens, by activating security notifications in the application's settings. At the heart of the matter is the exchange of cryptographic keys when two people start chatting to each other: their public keys are sent through Facebook's servers, and ideally the two people need to verify outside of WhatsApp that their keys haven't been tampered with during the handover. If it's not possible to verify the keys, or there isn't an opportunity to verify the keys, you're potentially open to man-in-the-middle surveillance. For example, a snooper could stop a WhatsApp message from being sent, take over the recipient's phone number, trigger a public key exchange between the sender and the snooper's handset that's now using the recipient's hijacked number, receive the redelivered text before the sender has a chance to verify the new public key, and decrypt the message they're not supposed to read. This is non-trivial to exploit and rather easy to detect when it happens, rendering it pointless. The problem \u2013 which is \"endemic to public key cryptography\" \u2013 was raised in April last year, and at the time WhatsApp said it wasn't a serious enough design flaw to spend time fixing. Now allegations that WhatsApp deliberate knackered its security have flared up again, this time reported in The Guardian. In response, the Facebook-owned messaging service said it designed its app to redeliver messages as described above to allow texts to be sent in parts of the world where people frequently swap devices and SIM cards. At WhatsApp, we\u2019ve always believed that people\u2019s conversations should be secure and private. Last year, we gave all our users a better level of security by making every message, photo, video, file and call end-to-end encrypted by default.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was claimed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: stresses, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

In WhatsApp's implementation of the Signal Protocol, we have a \u201cShow Security Notifications\u201d setting (option under Settings > Account > Security) that notifies you when a contact's security code has changed. We know the most common reasons this happens are because someone has switched phones or reinstalled WhatsApp. This is because in many parts of the world, people frequently change devices and SIM cards. In these situations, we want to make sure people's messages are delivered, not lost in transit. The alleged weakness in WhatsApp\u2019s encryption system was documented by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, and branded a \"backdoor\" today in The Grauniad. The paper fears governments can abuse the messenger app's design, which is based on Open Whisper's Signal protocol, to snoop on people's conversations. Some infosec bods are critical of Facebook\u2019s design decisions in rolling out its end-to-end encryption in WhatsApp. Neil Cook, chief security architect at Open-Xchange, commented: \u201cWhatsApp has already broken their promise not to share user data with Facebook, and now it seems that their promise of end-to-end encrypted messaging isn\u2019t quite as secure as everyone had hoped, particularly given the involvement of Open Whisper Systems.

Matthew Aldridge, solutions architect at Webroot, added: \u201cThis flaw allows Facebook/WhatsApp to intercept messages if they choose to, by having the sender\u2019s software automatically flip across to a second encryption key. The functionality is designed to create a seamless user experience for users who have connectivity issues or drop offline for a time during a conversation, but it has resulted in a situation where it could be used to intercept messages by WhatsApp. For those sending highly sensitive messages, or simply looking to avoid this, you should switch on the key change warnings in settings, and always check that the two ticks appear after sending messages in an active conversation\u201d.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was documented, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: branded, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Jacob Ginsberg, senior director at Echoworx, an expert in end-to-end messaging encryption, said: \u201cThe fact that Facebook has known about this vulnerability since April is doubly damming.

WhatsApp does not give governments a \u201cbackdoor\u201d into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor. The design decision referenced in the Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks.

SNMP is used for automated network device identification, monitoring and remote configuration. It is supported and enabled by default in many devices, including servers, printers, networking hubs, switches and routers. Independent researchers Ezequiel Fernandez and Bertin Bervis recently found a way to bypass SNMP authentication on 78 models of cable modems that ISPs from around the world have provided to their customers. Their internet scans revealed hundreds of thousands of devices whose configurations could be changed remotely through the SNMP weakness that they found and dubbed StringBleed. The leaking of sensitive configuration data through the default \"public\" SNMP community string is a known problem that has affected many devices over the years. The two researchers first located a small number of vulnerable devices, including the Cisco DPC3928SL cable modem that's now part of Technicolor's product portfolio following the company's acquisition of Cisco's Connected Devices division in 2015. The researchers claim that when they reported the issue to Technicolor, the company told them that it was the result of an access misconfiguration by a single ISP in Mexico rather than a problem with the device itself. This prompted the researchers to perform a wider internet scan that resulted in the discovery of 78 vulnerable cable modem models from 19 manufacturers, including Cisco, Technicolor, Motorola, D-Link and Thomson. Regardless of the cause, the problem is serious, as attackers could exploit this flaw to extract administrative and Wi-Fi passwords or to hijack devices by modifying their configurations. There's not much that users can do if their ISP supplied them with a vulnerable device, other than ask for a different model or install their own modem. Unfortunately, not many ISPs allow their residential customers to use their own gateway devices, because they want uniformity and remote management capabilities on their networks. Determining if a particular device is vulnerable to this issue is possible, but requires a bit of work. An online port scanner like ShieldsUp can be used to determine if the device responds to SNMP requests over its public IP address.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: are vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: The leaking, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: has affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: located, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: claim, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the discovery, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The new program, dubbed OSX/Dok by researchers from Check Point Software Technologies, was distributed via email phishing campaigns to users in Europe. One of the rogue emails was crafted to look as if it was sent by a Swiss government agency warning recipients about apparent errors in their tax returns. The malware was attached to the email as a file called Dokument.zip. Once installed on a Mac, OSX/Dok displays a fake and persistent notification about a system security update that needs to be installed. Users who agree to install the update will be prompted for their administrator password. Once the malware obtains elevated privileges, it will make the active user a permanent administrator so the OS will never ask for the password again when the malware executes privileged commands in the background. Dok will also modify the system's network settings to route web traffic through a proxy server controlled by the attackers and\u00a0located on the Tor anonymity network. In order for this to work, it also installs a Tor client that's started automatically. The reason why web traffic is routed through a proxy server is to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack and decrypt secure HTTPS connections. This is achieved by installing a rogue root certificate on the system that is then used to decrypt and re-encrypt HTTPS connections when they pass through the proxy. With this method, users will continue to see the SSL visual indicator in their browser when they access HTTPS websites and the browser will not complain about untrusted certificates. The ability to snoop on HTTPS traffic allows attackers to steal sensitive information like passwords for email; social media and online banking accounts; credit card details entered on shopping websites; personal and financial information entered into web forms; and more. With more than half of all web traffic in an average user's browser now encrypted, it's not surprising that attackers are resorting to man-in-the-middle techniques to capture sensitive data. This and other capabilities make Dok one of the most sophisticated malware programs targeting\u00a0macOS to date, not counting spy programs created or used by nation states and law enforcement agencies.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: email phishing campaigns, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: was crafted, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: was sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: displays, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: capture, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

TDO is one of the most well-known figures in today's dwindling hacker landscape. He first appeared on the scene in late 2015 and made a name for himself by hacking healthcare organizations, stealing their data, and trying to extract ransoms from victims by threatening to release sensitive data to the public. The hacker's online presence shrunk in the past few months, as many hoped he called it quits and moved on to other activities. Last night, at around 22:00 UTC (17:00 ET), your reporter noticed the hacker posting links on his Twitter profile that linked to a Pastebin page, GitHub profile, and a Pirate Bay torrent sharing episode 1 of season 5 of Netflix's \"Orange Is The New Black\" show. We didn't manage to get ahold of the Pastebin and GitHub links because they went down 20 minutes after they were posted, but we presume the links contained ransom demands. On the other hand, the Pirate Bay torrent file remained online, and users have downloaded and shared its content. Twelve hours later, TDO posted a new set of links on Twitter. These included a statement posted on Pastebin and a second torrent file, also hosted on The Pirate Bay, containing episodes 2 through 10 of the same season 5 of \"Orange Is The New Black.\" In the Pastebin statement, TDO says he released the ten \"Orange Is The New Black\" episodes because Netflix didn't want to pay a ransom demand. While we weren't able to get in touch with TDO after numerous attempts, the hacker spoke with the administrator of DataBreaches.net, a reporter named Dissent. In their interview, TDO revealed he discovered \"hundreds of GBs of unreleased and non-public media,\" on the servers of a Hollywood studio. The hacker didn't clarify if the server was exposed accidentally, or if he hacked it. DataBreaches.net identified the studio as Larson Studios, Inc., an audio post-production company, who later confirmed TDO's extortion attempt via email.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: blackmail, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hacking, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stealing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: extract ransoms, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay a ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: TDO's extortion, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

At this point, the hacker turned from the studio to Netflix. According to TDO's statement, Netflix didn't want to pay his ransom demand either, and after two months he was forced to release the first ten episodes of season 5 of \"Orange Is The New Black.\" According to Netflix's website, season 5 is supposed to have 13 episodes and is scheduled for release in June, this year.

A short time later, TheDarkOverlord released episodes 2 though 10, along with a warning to other Hollywood studios \u2013 you're next. The media jumped on the story. Netflix wouldn't confirm or deny the leaked episodes were legitimate, stating that proper law enforcement had been notified, and that a company used by several TV studios \"had its security compromised.\" The company in question, Larson Studios, does audio post-production work for a number of shows and films, including NCIS Los Angeles, Designated Survivor, and Arrested Development. According to Larson Studios, they've done work for FOX, Netflix, ABC, NBC, IFC, Showtime, and more. As word of Netflix's security problem started to spread, news outlets starting comparing the incident to the Sony Pictures hack and the medical hacks over the last few years. While there are some comparisons to be made, they're not the same type of threat. Netflix didn't have a Ransomware incident, and neither did Larson Studios. Their files were stolen, not encrypted. Ransomware encrypts the files on a computer and renders them useless. Victims can recover the files if they pay a fee (ransom), or they can try and recover the files from backups. According to TheDarkOverlord, Larson Studios was targeted because they were a post-production company. Late last year, TheDarkOverlord hacked Larson Studios and downloaded an unknown number of files. Plenty of reporters knew TheDarkOverlord had targeted Hollywood, but until this weekend there was never any proof. Fast forward a few months. When Larson Studios didn't comply with the extortion demands, TheDarkOverlord turned their attention to Netflix. When Netflix refused to pay, season five (minus three episodes) of \"Orange is the New Black\" was released for download. \"It didn't have to be this way, Netflix.

While having one of their popular series leaked to the web isn't exactly helpful, it isn't clear if there will be any financial impact from this incident. Once again, extortion and Ransomware are two separate things. Netflix and Larson Studios are (were) being extorted, they were not infected with Ransomware and have complete access to their files.

The vulnerability, disclosed on Monday, affects features in Intel firmware that are designed for enterprise IT management. \u00a0 Enterprises using Intel Active Management Technology, Intel Small Business Technology and Intel Standard Manageability on their systems should patch them as soon as possible, the company says. The vulnerable firmware features can be found in some current Core processors and all the way back to Intel's first-generation Core, called Nehalem, which shipped in 2008. They're part of versions 6.0 through 11.6 of Intel's manageability firmware. No consumer PCs are affected, the company said. Nor are data-center servers running Intel Server Platform Services.

Darkleech is a long-running campaign that uses exploit kits to deliver malware. The executable downloaded logs delivered by exploit kits were analyzed through a behavior analysis engine, which identified the executable file as Cerber ransomware based on behavior classification, Bala says.

First appearing in March 2016, Cerber often contains an audio file with a ransom message. The ransomware largely spreads via spear-phishing campaigns, security experts say.

The vulnerability hidden inside the coded software led to a breach of the database and the eventual exploit by unauthorized individuals,\u201d the company noted. \u201cAccording to the report, the attacker was able to break into a server that held database tables for Net Orbit, PhoneSheriff and TeenShield. The tables held information such as login usernames, subscription keys, device metadata, text messages, GPS locations, contacts\u2019 information, apps installed and website logs. A third-party photo storage account was also breached. Only accounts created before February 21st, 2017 were affected.\u201d They were quick to point out that no payment information was compromised, and they say that the attacker has not publicly released the stolen data \u2013 and he seemingly does not plan to. They are also trying to differentiate itself from the other victim (FlexiSpy), by saying that their software can\u2019t be used to monitor individuals that the monitorer has no legal right to keep under surveillance (e.g. their employees or their underage children), because this would violate their terms of service and the account would be terminated.  \u201cOur child and employee monitoring software shows up as an icon and in the Installed Apps list of devices.

The upstarts look unstoppable but might an obscure hacker called The Dark Overlord, previously connected to health sector data extortion, have spotted an important flaw in the model? Last week, Netflix found itself on the receiving end of a ransom demand from the individual or group, making unconfirmed demands in return for not releasing the unseen series 5 of the hit Orange Is the New Black, starring Dascha Polanco (pictured, at Toronto Pride)\u00a0to the web. The company, understandably, refused to play ball and on Saturday reports emerged that a number of episodes had appeared on a popular torrenting service, the name of which it behoves us not to mention for reasons including the high risk of encountering malware. Visiting that resource, we managed to find one file with mention of a \u201cpress release\u201d that has since been expunged, including from web caches. It reportedly read: We\u2019ve decided to release Episodes 2-10 of \u201cOrange Is The New Black\u201d Season 5 after many lengthy discussions at the office where alcohol was present. Separately, the group\u2019s Twitter feed crowed: And so let it be read that the loathsome giants do too fall. Hello Netflix, we\u2019ve arrived. The account threatened the release of material stolen from other media companies, including ABC, National Geographic and Fox. Netflix acknowledged the leak, which it said was caused by a breach at a \u201cproduction vendor\u201d also used by other TV studios. Netflix is cleverly covering its back by pointing the level of integration \u2013 and vulnerability \u2013 in the TV industry, but there is no question the breach still lands at its door. It\u2019s not clear whether the way streaming services process digital content is that different or less secure from established broadcasters but the minute a show exists in a form that can be copied it becomes vulnerable to theft.

One reason might be that content breaches aren\u2019t the same as ones involving customer data. The latter will cost the victim organisation money, court time and, in most countries, regulatory investigation. A few people watching a Netflix show earlier than normal seems minor by comparison as long as it doesn\u2019t happen too often. Assuming the company patches the hole that let its show be thieved, it\u2019s not stretching it to suggest The Dark Overlord\u2019s leaking could even have given Orange Is the New Black an unintended publicity jump.

The data comes from Alliance Direct Lending, which is based in Orange, California, writes Bob Diachenko, who works with the security research team at Kromtech Alliance Corp. of Germany. Alliance Direct Lending specializes in refinancing auto loans at a lower interest rate, and it also has partnerships with dealers across the country.  \"It is unclear if anyone other than security researchers accessed it or how long the data was exposed,\" Diachenko writes in a blog post.  Security researchers, as well as hackers, have had a field day lately exposing configuration mistakes organizations have made when setting up databases. Despite a string of well-publicized findings, the errors are still being made, or at least, not being caught. Aside from breaches, other organizations have seen their data erased and held for ransom, with notes left inside the databases asking for bitcoins (see Database Hijackings: Who's Next?).  Kromtech notified Alliance, which has since taken the data offline, Diachenko writes. Information Security Media Group's efforts to reach Alliance officials were not immediately successful. Under California's mandatory data breach notification law, Alliance would be required to report the breach.  \"The IT administrator claimed that it had only recently been leaked and was not was not up for long,\" Diachenko writes. \"He thanked us for the notification and the data was secured very shortly after the notification call.\"  Researchers came across the data while looking into Amazon Web Services Simple Storage Service (S3) \"buckets,\" which is the term for storage instances on the popular cloud hosting service. They were specifically hunting for buckets that had been left online but required no authentication.  The bucket contained 1,000 items, of which 210 were public. The leaked data included .csv files listed by dealerships located around the country. The number of consumer details leaked ranges between 550,000 up to 1 million, Diachenko writes. A screenshot posted on Kromtech's blog shows a sampling of the dealerships affected.  Kromtech shared with ISMG a data sample pertaining to a dealership in Michigan.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: asking for bitcoins, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: been leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

While full Social Security numbers weren't exposed, there's still a risk in leaking the last four digits. When trying to verify customers' identities, companies will sometimes ask for a fragment of data. So for fraudsters compiling dossiers, every bit, however incomplete, helps.  Also exposed were 20 phone call recordings with customers who were negotiating auto loan deals.  \"These consent calls were the customers agreeing that they understood they were getting an auto loan, confirming that the information was correct and true,\" Diachenko writes. \"They included the customer's name, date of birth, social security numbers, and phone numbers.\"  The bucket was last modified on Dec. 29, 2016, Kromtech writes.

The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), which issues the Aadhaar numbers, claims that there have been\u00a0no\u00a0leaks,\u00a0according to The Times of India.

The leaks didn't take place because of a flaw in the national Aadhaar system, but through government agencies that handle Aadhar data. According to the report, just four government programs are responsible for leaking a whopping number of 135 million records. The programs mentioned in the report are India's National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP), the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGA), the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh's Chandranna Bima Scheme, and the Govt. of Andhra Pradesh's Daily Online Payment Reports of NREGA. The prevalence of Aadhaar data is how The Centre for Internet and Society has discovered the leak. Improperly configured systems exposed the details of program participants on the Internet. While the full Aadhaar database was never exposed, details in the government program databases allow a fraudster to tie a person's leaked details (names, addresses, phone numbers) to an Aadhaar 12-digit ID. If enough of these details leak in different places, fraudster can build comprehensive profiles on Indian citizens, even recreating the Aadhaar database themselves. For its part, the Indian government has admitted that some of the Aadhaar database has leaked online through its ministries, said it started investigations, and is already preparing changes to Aadhaa'rs security policies.  Right now, because of the massive leak of 135 million details, including Aadhaar IDs, Indians stand to become victims of financial fraud.

Several people online across a range of industries said they received emails containing what looked like a link to a Google Doc that appeared to come from someone they know. These, however, were malicious emails designed to hijack their accounts.   It's unclear exactly how the attack works at the moment, but it does appear to be highly sophisticated. A Reddit user has a good breakdown of what happens exactly when you click on the Google Doc button. In a few words, when you click on the link, the login screen takes you to a genuine Google domain, but that domain asks you to grant access to an app called Google Docs that is not the real Google Docs. And the \"Google Docs\" app reads all your email and contacts, and then self-propagates by sending more emails.  We've also heard reports that Google Drive was down, and experienced the outage ourselves, but cannot yet confirm if that is related to the attack. (It'd be a hell of a coincidence, although Drive appears to be working again.)  \"We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,\" Google said in a statement sent to Motherboard. \"We've removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail.\" In a subsequent statement, Google said that the phishing campaign was halted \"within approximately an hour\" and that it \"affected fewer than 0.1% of Gmail users.\" While that sounds low, considering that Gmail has around 1 billion users, that's still around one million victims.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: A massive phishing campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: received, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: looked like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: appeared to come from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: pushed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: spoofing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: the phishing campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

The phishing emails, which circulated for about three hours before Google stopped them, invited the recipient to open what appeared to be a Google Doc. The teaser was a blue box that said, \u201cOpen in Docs.\u201d In reality, the link led to a dummy app that asked users for permission to access their Gmail account. An example of the phishing email that circulated on Tuesday. Users might easily have been fooled, because the dummy app was actually named \u201cGoogle Docs.\u201d It also asked for access to Gmail through Google\u2019s actual login service. The hackers were able to pull off the attack by abusing the OAuth protocol, a way for internet accounts at Google, Twitter, Facebook and other services to connect with third-party apps. \u00a0 The OAuth protocol doesn\u2019t transfer any password information, but instead uses special access tokens that can open account access. However, OAuth can be dangerous in the wrong hands. The hackers behind Tuesday\u2019s attack appear to have built an actual third-party app that leveraged Google processes to gain account access. The dummy app will try to ask for account permission.\u00a0 Last month, Trend Micro said a Russian hacking group known as Fancy Bear was using a similar email attack method that abused the OAuth protocol to phish victims. However, security experts said Tuesday's phishing attack probably wasn't from Fancy Bear, a shadowy group that many experts suspect works for the Russian government. \"I don't believe they\u00a0are behind this ... because this is way too widespread,\" Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at security provider AlienVault, said in an email.\u00a0 On Tuesday, many users on Twitter, including journalists,\u00a0posted screen shots of the phishing emails, prompting speculation that the hackers were harvesting victims' contact lists to target more users.

Targets received messages with the subject like \"[Sender] has shared a document on Google Docs with you\" often from senders they knew. The messages contained links, which led to a page that clearly requested access to the user's Gmail account. If the target user provides access, the attack begins sending spam to all the user's contacts. Theoretically, the attacker could also access the victim's messages and steal sensitive data, but thus far there have been no reports of such activity. Because it takes advantage of Google's legitimate third-party sharing mechanism, the phishing message is much more difficult to identify as malicious. The icons and messaging are familiar to Google users. Gmail itself did not filter the messages as phishing or flag them as spam, but rather sent them to Gmail users' \"Primary\" inbox mail folders. The senders were familiar enough to have the target in their contact lists.

It directs the user to a lookalike site and grants the site access to the target's Google credentials. If the victim clicks on the prompt to give the site permission to use Google credentials, the phish then harvests all the contacts in the victim's Gmail address book and adds them to its list of targets. The phish appears to have been initially targeted at a number of reporters, but it quickly spread widely across the Internet. Some of the sites associated with the attack appear to have been shut down. The e-mail uses a technique that a Trend Micro report linked last week to Pawn Storm, an ongoing espionage campaign frequently attributed to Russian intelligence operations. The attack uses the OAuth authentication interface, which is also used by many Web services to allow users to log in without using a password. By abusing OAuth, the attack is able to present a legitimate Google dialogue box requesting authorization. However, the authentication also asks permission for access to \"view and manage your e-mail\" and \"view and manage the files in your Google Drive.\" The fake application used in the Pawn Storm phish (which posed as a Google security alert) was named \"Google Defender.\" Today's phish asks the target to grant access to \"Google Docs\"\u2014a fake application using the name of Google's service. If the target grants permission, the malicious site will immediately harvest contacts from the target's e-mail and send copies of the original message to them.  [Update, 4:40 pm EDT:] Google has struck hard at the worm. Not only have all the sites associated with the phish been taken offline, but the permissions associated with the worm have been dropped from victims' accounts. The domains used in the attack were registered through NameCheap, and used a Panama-based privacy service to conceal the registration information.

It\u2019s unknown how many accounts were compromised, or whether other applications are also involved. Google advises caution in clicking on links in emails sharing Google Docs.  The messages purport to be from a contact, including contacts known to the victim, wanting to share a Google Doc file. Once the \u201cOpen in Docs\u201d button is clicked, the victim is redirected to Google\u2019s OAUTH2 service and the user is prompted to allow the attacker\u2019s malicious application, called \u201cGoogle Docs,\u201d below, to access their Google account and related services, including contacts, Gmail, Docs and more.  \u201cWe have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts,\u201d a Google spokesperson told Threatpost. \u201cWe\u2019ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.

According to multiple reports on Twitter, the attacks first hit journalists, businesses, and universities, but later spread to many other users as well. The attack itself was quite clever if we can say so ourselves. Victims received a legitimate (non-spoofed) email from one of their friends, that asked them to click on a button to receive access to a Google Docs document. If users clicked the button, they were redirected to the real Google account selection screen, where a fake app titled \"Google Docs\" (not the real one) asked the user's permission to authorize it to access the shared document. In reality, the app only wanted access to the user's Gmail inbox and contact list. After gaining access to these details, the fake app copied the user's contact list and sent a copy of itself to the new set of targets, spreading itself to more and more targets. The email was actually sent to \"hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com,\" with the user's email address added as BCC. Following the incident, Mailinator intervened and blocked any new emails from arriving into that inbox. Because of this self-replicating feature, the phishing attack spread like wildfire in a few minutes, just like the old Samy worm that devasted MySpace over a decade ago. Fortunately, one Google staff member was visting the /r/Google Reddit thread, and was able to spot a trending topic detailing the phishing campaign. The Google engineer forwarded the Reddit thread to the right person, and within an hour after users first complained about the issue, Google had already disabled the fake app's ability to access the Google OAuth screen. Later on, as engineers had more time to investigate the issue, Google issued the following statement: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs & have disabled offending accounts. We\u2019ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail.

An update to version 4.3.1 of the Fuze platform on March 10 rectified the issue. \"Security is a top priority for Fuze and we appreciate Rapid7 identifying this issue and bringing it to our attention. When we were informed by the Rapid7 team of the issue, we took immediate action and have resolved the problem,\" Fuze said in a statement.\u00a0 The vulnerability was caused by the way in which the platform incrementally added digits to the URL of recorded meetings, which resulted in relatively easy brute-force attacks proving successful.\u00a0 Combining the simple ability to guess URLs by inputting seven digit numbers with no requirement for authentication was always going to bring\u00a0the potential for disaster, though there's no suggestion that anyone with nefarious intent\u00a0accessed any of the meetings.\u00a0 \"Recorded Fuze meetings are saved to Fuze's cloud hosting service. They could be accessed by URLs such as 'https://browser.fuzemeeting.com/?replayId=7DIGITNUM', where '7DIGITNUM' is a seven digit number that increments over time,\" Rapid7 explains. \"Since this identifier did not provide sufficient keyspace to resist bruteforcing, specific meetings could be accessed and downloaded by simply guessing a replay ID reasonably close to the target, and iterating through all likely seven digit numbers.

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.  A phishing email attack potentially compromised the accounts of as many as 18,000 current and former employees of media company\u00a0Gannett Co. As of Tuesday there was no indication of\u00a0access to or acquisition of any sensitive personal data from employees\u2019 accounts, said the company. Gannett Co. (GCI) is the owner of USA TODAY, the publisher of this report, and 109 local news properties across the United States. The attack was discovered on March 30 and\u00a0investigated by Gannett\u2019s cybersecurity team. It appeared to originate in emails to human resources staff. The 18,000 current and former employees of the company will be sent notices about the incident and offer of credit monitoring via the US Postal Service.\u00a0 No customer account information was touched by the phishing attack. They will be provided with an offer of credit monitoring because employee information was potentially available through some of the affected account login credentials before the accounts were locked down. Phishing attacks are a common method used by attackers to infiltrate computer networks. They typically consist of faked emails sent to an employee that entice them to click on a link that unleashes malicious software that can compromise their computer accounts. Once in a network, attackers can then leapfrog to other accounts, working their way deeper into the system. In the Gannett attack, the infiltration was discovered\u00a0when the\u00a0perpetrator attempted to use a co-opted account\u00a0for a fraudulent corporate wire transfer request.

DN reported that the list of targets is\u00a0long, including embassies and ministries in more than 40 countries, several NATO and EU institutions, political and military leaders, well-known journalists, activists and academics. Most haven\u2019t been aware they were attacked when they clicked on links in email that seemed to come from people they knew.

The attacks in Norway only make up 2 percent of attacks on military and political institutions, DN reported, but local authorities are on high alert for more. The US\u2019 FBI, CIA and NSA have all described the attacks as the largest Russian attempt to gain influence in the US ever.

Google said that up to 1 million Gmail users were victimized by yesterday\u2019s Google Docs phishing scam that spread quickly for a short period of time. In a statement, Google said that fewer than 0.1 percent of Gmail users were affected; as of last February, Google said it had one billion active Gmail users. Google took measures to protect its users by disabling offending accounts, and removing phony pages and malicious applications involved in the attacks. Other security measures were pushed out in updates to Gmail, Safe Browsing and other in-house systems. \u201cWe were able to stop the campaign within approximately one hour,\u201d a Google spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWhile contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed.

Many of the phishing messages came from contacts known to victims since part of the attack includes gaining access to contact lists. The messages claimed that someone wanted to share a Google Doc with the victim, and once the \u201cOpen in Docs\u201d button in the email is clicked, the victim is redirected to a legitimate Google OAUTH consent screen where the attacker\u2019s application, called \u201cGoogle Docs\u201d asks for access to victim\u2019s Gmail and contacts through Google\u2019s OAUTH2 service implementation. While the ruse was convincing in its simplicity, there were a number of red flags, including the fact that a Google service was asking for access to Gmail, and that the \u201cTo\u201d address field was to an odd Mailinator account. Google also quickly updated Safe Browsing and Gmail with warnings about the phishing emails and attempts to steal personal information.

While the RaaS has not yet received any endorsements or feedback from the hacking community, on March 26, \u201cilcn,\u201d a reputable member of the forum, offered to assist polnowz with translation in the product. The Fatboy ransomware is dynamic in the way it targets its victims; the amount of ransom demanded is determined by the victim\u2019s location. According to polnowz, Fatboy uses a payment scheme based on The Economist\u2019s Big Mac Index (cited as the \u201cMcDonald\u2019s Index\u201d in the product description), meaning that victims in areas with a higher cost of living will be charged more to have their data decrypted. Purchasers of the Fatboy RaaS partner directly with the author of the malware and not through a third-party vendor. Potential partners also receive payment instantly when a victim pays their ransom, adding another level of transparency to this partnership. Since February 7, 2017, the author of the Fatboy RaaS has purportedly earned at least $5,321 USD from their own ransomware campaigns using this product. A computer infected with the Fatboy malware will display the above message, explaining that the user\u2019s files have been encrypted, stating the ransom amount, and warning the user against interfering with the ransomware. The level of transparency in the Fatboy RaaS partnership may be a strategy to quickly gain the trust of potential buyers.

The researcher published his findings yesterday, after reporting the flaw to the WordPress security team last July. After more than ten months and no progress, Golunski decided to go public and inform WordPress site owners of this issue so they could protect their sites by other means. The issue, tracked via the CVE-2017-8295 identifier, affects all WordPress versions and is related to how WordPress sites put together the password reset emails. According to Golunski, an attacker can craft a malicious HTTP request that triggers a tainted password reset operation by injecting a custom SERVER_NAME variable, such as \"attacker-domain.com\". This means that when the WordPress site puts together the password reset email, the \"From\" and \"Return-Path\" values will be in the form of \"wordpress@attacker-domain.com\". Most users would think this zero-day is useless, as the attacker wouldn't achieve anything more than sending a password reset email to the legitimate site owner, but from the wrong Sender address. These complex exploitation scenarios are most likely the main reason why the WordPress team has not prioritized patching this issue until now. The same opinion is shared by security experts from Sucuri, a vendor of web-based security products, recently acquired by GoDaddy. \"The vulnerability exists, but is not as critical as advertised for several reasons,\" said Sucuri vulnerability researcher Marc Montpas. \"The whole attack relies on the fact that the victim's email is not accessible at the time the attack is occurring, which greatly reduces the chance of a successful attack.\" His colleague, Denis Sinegubko, also shared his thoughts on the issue. \"After a brief reading and assuming the attack works, it has limited impact as it requires an individual site to be accessible by IP address, so will not work for most sites on shared servers. Only for poorly configured dedicated servers.\" \"The whole attack scenario is theoretically possible but in practice, I don't see thousands of sites getting hacked because of this vulnerability any time soon,\" Montpas added.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: published his findings, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reporting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: go public and inform, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: tracked, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: exists, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

On 3 May, a representative with O2 Telefonica, a provider of mobile phones and broadband, told German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung that thieves managed to bypass security measures and make unauthorized withdrawals from customers\u2019 bank accounts:     \u201cCriminals carried out an attack from a network of a foreign mobile network operator in the middle of January. The attack redirected incoming SMS messages for selected German customers to the attackers.\u201d The thieves pulled off their heist by exploiting the weak underbelly of SS7. It\u2019s a protocol that specifies how public switched telephone networks (PSTN) exchange data over digital signaling network. In simpler terms, SS7 helps phone carriers around the world route your calls and text messages. Useful! Unfortunately, it\u2019s also terribly insecure. That\u2019s what researchers Tobias Engel and Karsten Nohl found back in 2014. Specifically, the duo discovered flaws in the protocol that allowed an attacker to intercept a victim\u2019s mobile phone calls as well as use a radio antenna to pick up all of a local user\u2019s phone calls and texts. Along the researchers\u2019 observations, the January attackers first compromised users\u2019 computers with malware that stole their bank account numbers, login credentials, and mobile phone numbers. The Register reports that these criminals then waited until the middle of the night to spring into action. For those accounts protected by SMS-based 2SV (not to be confused with 2FA), the attackers abused SS7 to redirect customers\u2019 SMS text messages to phone numbers under their control. This exploit allowed the thieves to steal users\u2019 mobile transaction authentication numbers (mTAN) and thereby withdraw money from their accounts. In the aftermath of the attack, authorities blocked the unidentified foreign network exploited by the attackers. Bank officials also notified customers of the unauthorized withdrawals. But that\u2019s not all. Some people are now calling on the FCC to fix the (finally!) fix the issues affecting SS7.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: drain, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stole, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Checker ATM Security is a specialized security solution aimed at keeping ATMs safe from logical attacks. It does so by enforcing application whitelisting, full hard disk encryption, providing ACL-based control of process execution and resource access, enforcing security policies, restricting attempts to connect peripheral devices, and so on. The found flaw can be exploited to remotely run code on a targeted ATM, increase the attacker\u2019s privileges in the system, and compromise the machine completely. \u201cTo exploit the vulnerability, a criminal would need to pose as the control server, which is possible via ARP spoofing, or by simply connecting the ATM to a criminal-controlled network connection,\u201d researcher Georgy Zaytsev explained. \u201cDuring the process of generating the public key for traffic encryption, the rogue server can cause a buffer overflow on the ATM due to failure on the client side to limit the length of response parameters and send a command for remote code execution. This can give an attacker full control over the ATM and allow a variety of manipulations, including unauthorized money withdrawal\u201d.\u201d When informed of the vulnerability and provided with test exploits, GMV confirmed its existence and that it affects versions 4.x and 5.x of the software, and ultimately pushed out a patch, which users are urged to install as soon as possible. Exploitation not detected in the wild A company spokesperson has made sure to point out that there is no indication that the vulnerability has been exploited in attacks in the wild. Also, that exploitation is not that easy, as the attacker must first gain access to the ATM network and log into the target system. \u201cSecondly, the attack is difficult to be systematically exploited in an ATM network. In order to exploit it, the attacker needs some memory address that are strongly dependent on Windows kernel version, while in Windows XP systems could be theoretically possible to take advantage of the vulnerability, in Windows 7 is almost impossible because those memory address are different in every windows installation,\u201d the spokesperson told The Register.

He managed to buy a new one, but kept the same number for convenience. Nothing appeared to be out of the ordinary at first\u2014until he realized the thief changed his Facebook password. Fortunately, he was able to recover and update it, as his phone number was tied to his Facebook account. But a pickpocket accessing his victim\u2019s Facebook account is quite unusual. After all, why would a crook be interested with his victim\u2019s Facebook account for when the goal is usually to use or sell the stolen device? It didn\u2019t stop there; a day after, my friend curiously received a phishing SMS message on his new phone. What\u2019s interesting here is the blurred line between traditional felony and cybercrime\u2014in particular, the apparent teamwork between crooks and cybercriminals that results in further\u2014possibly more sophisticated\u2014attacks.  Figure 1: SMS message with a link to a phishing page The SMS message, written in Portuguese, translates to: \u201cDear user: Your device in lost mode was turned on and found; access here and view its last location:\u201d. The message was accompanied with a link pointing to hxxp://busca-devices[.]pe[.]hu, which we found to be a phishing page with a log-in form asking for Apple ID credentials. We then checked the last location of his stolen iPhone, the official iCloud website indeed confirmed that it was where he had the phone snatched.  Figure 2: Phishing page asking for Apple ID credentials Connecting the dots, it appears the modus operandi is to physically steal the victim\u2019s phone (while in use, so they can still access the apps), uncover the device\u2019s number, then try changing the password of installed social networking (and possibly email) apps\u2014probably to extort the victim in the future\u2014before turning the stolen device off as soon as possible.

The phishing page offered for rent came with a video tutorial explaining how the service works. Coincidence? While there may be no direct correlation, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it somehow intersects with my friend\u2019s iPhone scam situation\u2014given how Apple credentials are one of the commodities sold in Brazil\u2019s online underworld.

This is according to technical analyses published Friday. Further ReadingIntel patches remote hijacking vulnerability that lurked in chips for 7 years. As Ars reported Monday, the authentication bypass vulnerability resides in a feature known as Active Management Technology. AMT, as it's usually called, allows system administrators to perform a variety of powerful tasks over a remote connection. Among the capabilities: changing the code that boots up computers, accessing the computer's mouse, keyboard, and monitor, loading and executing programs, and remotely powering on computers that are turned off. In short, AMT makes it possible to log into a computer and exercise the same control enjoyed by administrators with physical access. AMT, which is available with many vPro processors, was set up to require a password before it could be remotely accessed over a Web browser interface. But, remarkably, that authentication mechanism can be bypassed by entering no text at all. According to a blog post published Friday by Tenable Network Security, the cryptographic hash that the interface's digest access authentication requires to verify someone is authorized to log in can be anything at all, including no string at all. \"Authentication still worked\" even when the wrong hash was entered, Tenable Director of Reverse Engineering Carlos Perez wrote. \"We had discovered a complete bypass of the authentication scheme.\" A separate technical analysis from Embedi, the security firm Intel credited with first disclosing the vulnerability, arrived at the same conclusion.  Embedi e-mailed the analysis to reporters, but didn't publish it online. Making matters worse, unauthorized accesses typically aren't logged by the PC because AMT has direct access to the computer's network hardware. When AMT is enabled, all network packets are redirected to the Intel Management Engine and from there to the AMT. The packets bypass the OS completely. The vulnerable management features were made available in some but not all Intel chipsets starting in 2010, Embedi has said. In a blog post published Friday, Intel officials said they expect PC makers to release a patch next week. The releases will update Intel firmware, meaning patching will require that each vulnerable chip set is reflashed.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: patches, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: resides in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: update, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patching, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

You and your customers could get badly bitten \u2013 and so they have. The\u00a0Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) telephony signaling protocol used to establish interoperability across some 800+ service providers worldwide, is deeply vulnerable to interception by hackers, criminals, and corrupt insiders. We\u2019ve known this for years. Now, in Germany, someone\u2019s used that vulnerability to raid consumers\u2019 online bank accounts. SS7 was designed back in the 1970s, when access to phone networks was viewed as rare and controllable: back then, for example, AT&T still had an essentially complete monopoly over all US phone service. But now, a world of internet, VoIP, and wireless providers can link into SS7 to do all manner of fascinating things, and mess-with-SS7 skills and tools aren\u2019t nearly so scarce. The telecom industry, however, has been appallingly slow to react. Maybe they will now. As first reported by the German daily newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung, this two-part attack zeroed in on SS7 call-forwarding features that allow networks to validate your SIM card when you travel internationally. First, according to Bank Info Security, hackers sent conventional fake phishing emails to victims, suckering them into visiting fake bank websites, where they were told to enter account numbers, passwords and the mobile phone numbers they had previously given their banks. Meanwhile, per The Register, the attackers \u201cpurchased access to a rogue telecommunications provider and set up a redirect for the victim\u2019s mobile phone number to a handset controlled by the attackers\u201d. Now, they could wait until late at night, log into the victims\u2019 online accounts, and start money transfers. As part of their SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) systems, the banks would dutifully send one-time mobile transaction authentication number (mTAN) numbers to their customers. These would be hijacked by the criminals, who now had the second authentication factor they needed to complete the thefts.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Dubbed Netrepser, the framework is used to find and exfiltrate all kinds of information from compromised Windows systems. The researchers believe that it is wielded by a dedicated cyber espionage group, as the victims are mostly computer systems of government agencies. Netrepser is usually delivered via spear-phishing emails spoofed to look like they are coming from a legitimate source. The email purports to deliver a document containing guidelines for discussion or a similar benign DOC file, and the recipient is urged to enable macros in order to view the contents of the file: But doing that will allow the embedded Visual Basic macro to drop a JavaScript file (JS) or a JScript Encoded File (JSE).

On Friday, news outlet The Guardian reported that a cryptography researcher had discovered a backdoor in WhatsApp\u2019s messaging service that could \u201callow Facebook and others to intercept and read encrypted messages\u201d. In a short statement, WhatsApp said the claim was false: \u201cWhatsApp does not give governments a \u2018backdoor\u2019 into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor. The design decision referenced in The Guardian story prevents millions of messages from being lost, and WhatsApp offers people security notifications to alert them to potential security risks. WhatsApp published a technical white paper on its encryption design, and has been transparent about the government requests it receives, publishing data about those requests in the Facebook Government Requests Report\u201d. The Guardian report cited research by Tobias Boelter, a cryptography and security researcher at the University of California, Berkeley. Last April, Boelter disclosed his findings to WhatsApp and published a report on what he posited could be either a backdoor or a flaw in WhatsApp\u2019s messaging platform. Boelter later told\u00a0The Guardian the \u201cbackdoor\u201d gave WhatsApp the ability to read messages because of the way the company had implemented its end-to-end encryption protocol. Reporters quoted Kirstie Ball, co-director and founder of the Centre for Research into Information, Surveillance and Privacy who verified Boelter\u2019s research and stated\u00a0the \u201cbackdoor\u201d made WhatsApp an \u201can extremely insecure platform\u201d. The Guardian explains Boelter\u2019s alleged backdoor like this: WhatsApp\u2019s end-to-end encryption relies on the generation of unique security keys, using the acclaimed Signal protocol,\u00a0developed by Open Whisper Systems, that are traded and verified between users to guarantee communications are secure and cannot be intercepted by a middleman. However, WhatsApp has the ability to force the generation of new encryption keys for offline users, unbeknown to the sender and recipient of the messages, and to make the sender re-encrypt messages with new keys and send them again for any messages that have not been marked as delivered.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Claims, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: had discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: cited research, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: published a report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: told, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

WhatsApp, acquired by Facebook in 2014, supports end-to-end encryption and is considered a secure messaging platform based on the highly regarded Signal protocol, developed by Open Whisper Systems. The app boasts one billion users and has been endorsed by the likes of Edward Snowden for keeping private messages private. Claims of a WhatsApp backdoor have been staunchly dismissed by a number security researchers and cryptography experts. Moxie Marlinspike, the founder of Open Whisper Systems also agrees with WhatsApp telling Threatpost, \u201cThe Guardian reporting is inaccurate, there is no \u2018backdoor\u2019 in WhatsApp encryption. Unfortunately it appears that they did not speak with any cryptography experts in order to verify their claims\u201d. Marlinspike also posted a more technical explanation behind what Boelter found. In a nutshell, he explains what Boelter says is a backdoor is actually something all public key cryptography system have to deal with. \u201cWhatsApp gives users the option to be notified when those changes occur,\u201d he wrote. Frederic Jacobs, a key developer of the private messaging app Signal, called the claims of a backdoor \u201cridiculous\u201d. In a tweet he said \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous that this is presented as a backdoor. If you don\u2019t verify keys, authenticity of keys is not guaranteed.

Google Project Zero's security researchers have discovered another critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s Windows operating system, claiming that it is something truly bad. Tavis Ormandy announced during the weekend that he and another Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich discovered \"the worst Windows remote code [execution vulnerability] in recent memory. This is crazy bad. Report on the way.\" Ormandy did not provide any further details of the Windows RCE bug, as Google gives a 90-day security disclosure deadline to all software vendors to patch their products and disclose it to the public. This means the details of the new RCE vulnerability in Windows will likely be disclosed in 90 days from now even if Microsoft fails to patch the issue. However, Ormandy later revealed some details of the Windows RCE flaw, clarifying that:  The vulnerability they claimed to have discovered works against default Windows installations. The attacker does not need to be on the same local area network (LAN) as the victim, which means vulnerable Windows computers can be hacked\u00a0remotely. The attack is \"wormable,\" capability to spread itself.  Despite not even releasing any technical details on the RCE flaw, some IT professionals working for corporates have criticized the Google Project Zero researcher for making the existence of the vulnerability public, while Twitter's infosec community is happy with the work. \"If a tweet is causing panic or confusion in your organization, the problem isn't the tweet, the problem is your organization,\" Project Zero researcher Natalie Silvanovich tweeted. This is not the first time when Google's security researchers have discovered flaws in Microsoft\u2019s products. Most recently in February, Google researchers disclosed the details of an unpatched vulnerability impacting Microsoft's Edge and Internet Explorer browsers. Microsoft released a patch as part of its next Patch Tuesday but criticized Google for making all details public, exposing millions of its Windows users at risk of being hacked.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: provide, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclose, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: impacting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Then, security researchers revealed the problem was way worse than anyone initially thought as the vulnerability could allow attackers to remotely \"hijack\" affected machines. It's still not clear just how many devices are impacted as Intel has't said, but some in the industry have put the number as high as 8,000. Here's a look at what you need to know and how to protect yourself. The vulnerability stems from something called Intel Active Management Technology, (AMT), a technology that allows devices to be remotely managed to make it easier to update software and perform maintenance remotely. It's a feature typically used by businesses that may be responsible for many devices that may not all be in the same place. Since the technology is integrated at a chip level, AMT can do a bit more than other software-enabled management tools. Using AMT's capabilities, for instance, a system administrator could remotely access and control a computer's mouse and keyboard, or turn on a computer that's already been powered down.\u00a0 While those can be helpful capabilities for corporate IT departments to have, it's obviously the type of access you'd want locked down pretty tightly. And that's just the problem. Security researchers found that AMT's web portal can be accessed with just the user admin and literally any password or even no password at all.\u00a0 That's why some have labeled it a \"hijacking\" flaw since anyone who exploits the vulnerability would be able to remotely control so many processes.\u00a0 Most importantly, the flaw doesn't impact every Intel chip out there. Since it's rooted in AMT, the vulnerability primarily affects businesses, though, as Intel points out, some consumers use computers made for businesses.\u00a0 One of the easiest ways to check if you might be affected is to check that Intel sticker that comes on so many PCs. Look for a \"VPro\" logo as that indicates the presence of AMT. Of course, looking for a sticker is hardly foolproof. Intel has also released a downloadable detections guide, which will guide you through the process of checking your machines. You can find the detection guide here.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are impacted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: impact, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: rooted in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

ESET Ireland have looked at recent cyber threats arriving by mail in recent weeks, and they are advising caution as one link could see your money stolen. The cyber security company say that for the people sending these malicious emails, it\u2019s a numbers game that they are playing. IT security and cybercrime analyst for ESET Ireland, Urban Schrott, said: \"Send out enough spam and a certain percentage of victims will click. So, week after week, we\u2019re seeing new scams or new variations on old scams. The past weeks were no exception.\" One such email that was sent out this week was targeted at Tesco Bank customers - the elaborate letter pretended to have come from the Tesco Bank credit card team. It reads: \u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to contact you about your account, but we've been unable to reach you. Your account has been restricted. To continue using our online services and have your account restored, just to keep you safe, kindly confirm your identity and remove your account limitations with the reference link below.\u201d They would then proceed to kindly steal your log in details and try to log into your account to take your money. Bank of Ireland customers are also being targeted and ESET say that the Irish bank is \"always a popular name to abuse\". The company have detected two phishing variations which have recently targeted members of the banking institution. One convincing looking email claims: \u201cIn order to protect your funds and information, Bank of Ireland has set up a new enhanced security system, which will eliminate fraud and totally protect you. The new system is called Boi Secure Link. Click the Boi Secure Link below to enjoy the new security features.\u201d Of course, clicking on that link does everything but protect you, but instead attempts pretty much the same as the Tesco one. The second one was even simpler, but unfortunately, not less effective. It said: \u201cMy Inbox (1) ~ Your message is available to view on 365 online. Log in to 365Online\u201d. As curiosity tends to get the better of people, a \u201cnew message in the inbox\u201d is a good lure to get people clicking.

Earlier this year, hackers exploited vulnerabilities in the Signaling System No. 7 (SS7) protocols to sidestep two-factor authentication and steal funds from German victims' bank accounts, according to Germany's Suddeutsche Zeitung. The hackers stole bank login credentials via phishing emails that appeared to come from the victims' banks, then leveraged flaws in SS7 to redirect the SMS messages required to confirm funds transfers. \"Criminals carried out an attack from a network of a foreign mobile network operator in the middle of January,\" a representative of Germany's O2 Telefonica said, according to Ars Technica. \"The attack redirected incoming SMS messages for selected German customers to the attackers.\" Ars Technica notes that security researcher Karsten Nohl demonstrated the potential impact of the flaws in SS7 last year by recording calls and tracking the location of U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu. Earlier this week, Lieu tweeted, \"I've been screaming for FCC & telecom industry to fix #SS7 security flaw.

Hackers have reportedly hijacked insecure servers exposed to the internet with weak and easy-to-guess passwords. ElasticSearch is a Java-based search engine, commonly used by enterprises for information cataloguing and data analysis. According to security researcher Niall Merrigan, who has been monitoring the attacks, the cybercriminals are currently closing in on around 3,000 ElasticSearch servers. Merrigan told IBTimes UK: \"We found the first one on the 12th of Jan and then started tracking the different IOCs (Indicators Of Compromise). The first actor has levelled off and looks like it has stopped. However, a second and third actor have joined in and are continuing to compromise servers. \"Attackers are finding open servers where there is no authentication at all. This can be done via a number of services and tools. Unfortunately, system admins and developers have been leaving these unauthenticated systems online for a while and attackers are just picking off the low hanging fruit right now.\" The recent MongoDB attacks saw hackers demand ransom and erasing data to ensure victims' compliance. In the ongoing ElasticSearch attacks, the cybercriminals demand a ransom of 0.2 Bitcoins, according to a report by BleepingComputer. However, according to Merrigan, $20,000 in Bitcoins have already been paid by victims of the MongoDB attack. Despite paying the ransom, the victims have not received their data back. \"So in this case it is a scam,\" the researcher said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: were hit by ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The recent MongoDB attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ongoing ElasticSearch attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: have already been paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the MongoDB attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

On Friday night, security researcher Tavis Ormandy of Google\u2019s Project Zero announced on Twitter that he had found a Windows bug. Well, not just any bug. It was \u201ccrazy bad,\u201d Ormandy wrote. \u201cThe worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory.\u201d By Monday night, Microsoft had released an emergency patch, along with details of what the vulnerability entailed. And yes, it was every bit as scary as advertised. That\u2019s not only because of the extent of the damage hackers could have done, or the range of devices the bug affected. It\u2019s because the bug's fundamental nature underscores the vulnerabilities inherent in the very features meant to keep our devices safe. What made this particular bug so insidious was that it would have allowed hackers to target Windows Defender, an antivirus system that Microsoft builds directly into its operating system. That means two things: First, that it impacted the billion-plus devices that have Windows Defender installed. (Specifically, it took advantage of the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine that underpins several of the company\u2019s software security products.) Second, that it leveraged that program\u2019s expansive permissions to enable general havoc, without physical access to the device or the user taking any action at all. \u201cThis was, in fact, crazy bad,\u201d says Core Security systems engineer Bobby Kuzma, echoing Ormandy\u2019s original assessment.  As Google engineers note in a report on the bug, to pull off the attack a hacker would have only had to send a specialized email or trick a user into visiting a malicious website, or otherwise sneak an illicit file onto a device. This also isn\u2019t just a case of clicking the wrong link; because Microsoft\u2019s antivirus protection automatically inspects every incoming file, including unopened email attachments, all it takes to fall victim is an inbox. \u201cThe moment [the file] hits the system, the Microsoft malware protection intercepts it and scans it to make sure it\u2019s \u2018safe,\u2019\u201d says Kuzma. That scan triggers the exploit, which in turn enables remote code execution that enables a total machine takeover.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: announced, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: note, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: send, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

And because Microsoft issues automatic updates for its malware protection, most users should be fully protected soon, if not already. It should still serve as an object lesson, though, in the risks that come with antivirus software that has tendrils in every part of your system. It\u2019s a scary world out there, and antivirus generally helps make it less so. To do its job correctly, though, it needs unprecedented access to your computer\u2014meaning that if it falters, it can take your entire system down with it. \u201cThere is a raging debate about antivirus in some circles, stating that it can be used as a springboard to infect users,\u201d says J\u00e9r\u00f4me Segura, lead malware intelligence analyst with Malwarebytes. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that security software is not immune to flaws, just like any other program, but there is no denying the irony when an antivirus could be leveraged to infect users instead of protecting them.\u201d Irony and, well, damage. A year ago, Google\u2019s Ormandy found critical vulnerabilities that affected no fewer than 17 Symantec antivirus products. He\u2019s found similar in offerings from security vendors like FireEye, McAfee, and more. And more recently, researchers discovered an attack called \u201cDoubleAgent,\u201d which turned Microsoft\u2019s Application Verifier tool into a malware entry point. \u201cBecause of what they do, AV products are really complex and have to touch a lot of things that are untrusted,\u201d says Kuzma. \u201cThis is the kind of vulnerability we\u2019ve seen time and again.\u201d There\u2019s also no real solution; it\u2019s not easy to weigh the protections versus the risks.

That's a dramatic jump from the 100 variants created between October to the start of December, says Michael Covington, vice president of product strategy for Wandera, which published new data on the ransomware today. The new strains of the mobile ransomware use a range of disguises to avoid detection. The SLocker variations are repackaged as altered icon, for example, or offer unique resources and executable files. SLocker encrypts images, documents, and videos, as well as blocks access to the device before demanding payment to unlock the phone and its contents. Chief security officers and their teams have reason to worry about the rapid rise in the number of SLocker strains, say security experts. The malware has morphed beyond just locking users' screens on their Android devices and demanding payment, to taking over administrative rights and controlling the device, including its microphone, speakers, and the camera. Bogdan Botezatu, senior e-threat analyst with Bitdefender, says an Android smartphone infected with SLocker could potentially broadcast highly sensitive information presented during a closed-door boardroom meeting without the user's knowledge, for example. Wandera's Covington points to potential risks to sales and consulting staff, for example. \"In a lot of situations where the employees work out in the field like in sales or consulting, it can have a massive impact on their business if they are locked out of their phone and data,\" he explains. Victim organizations paid an estimated $10 million in ransom to unlock confidential data stored on Android phones that fell victim to SLocker, according to\u00a0Wandera's report.  Android ransomware first emerged in 2014, after creators of the Reveton/IcePol ransomware for PCs turned their attention to Android devices and cooked up the Android.Trojan. Koler.A and then later Android.Trojan.SLocker, according to Bitdefender's Botezatu. For the first two years, SLocker was among the top 20 Android malware families and then shot up to the top 10 in 2016, notes Botezatu. \"Its rise to the top 10 was mostly because of the frustration factor. It's a psychological thing when people can't get information from their smartphone,\" he says.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: demanding payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The UK-based Guardian newspaper\u2019s publisher, which runs the service, is blaming \u201chuman error\u201d and a third-party technology provider for the leak, which has now been fixed. According to the BBC, the site \u2014 which charges users up to \u00a332 ($41.50) per month \u2014 said that only email addresses and user IDs had been exposed directly. But that information can be used to dig out more from public profiles, said the company, including photos, relationship preferences and physical descriptions. Here\u2019s a statement the publisher sent to The Register:     We can confirm we have received 27 enquiries from our members which show evidence of their email addresses used for their Soulmates account having been exposed.     We take matters of data security extremely seriously and have conducted thorough audits of all our internal systems and are confident that no outside party breached any of these systems. Our ongoing investigations point to a human error by one of our third party technology providers, which led to an exposure of an extract of data. This extract contained only members\u2019 email addresses and user ID which can be used to find members\u2019 publicly available online profiles.     We have taken appropriate measures to ensure this does not happen again, and we continue to review our processes and third party suppliers.     Nonetheless, we apologise to our members who were affected. If any of our members are concerned we encourage them to contact us on support@guardiansoulmates.com. One user who contacted the BBC said they\u2019d starting receiving sexually explicit spam, laced with information from their Soulmates profile, in November. The user, who works in IT, said they weren\u2019t completely surprised. Things like this can happen with online services. But they were still a bit taken aback, given that they hadn\u2019t used the site for several years and they were no longer paying the membership fee. That user told the BBC that they had contacted Soulmates six months ago, concerned about what other information might have been breached. Another user who reached out to the BBC said that in spite of the breached information being public, it still felt \u201ccreepy\u201d to see it lifted from the confines of the dating site:[/INST]\n\nTrigger: leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: had been exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: been exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: extract, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: extract, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: been breached, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The 2016 Ransomware Report released by 360 Security Center lately presents that: \u2013 4.9 million computers were attacked in China  \u2013 56,000 ransomware infections worldwide only in March 2016  \u2013 $1 billion dollar source of income for cyber criminals estimated by FBI  \u2013 Almost half of organizations have been hit with ransomware In January 2016, three Indian banks\u2019 and a pharmaceutical company\u2019s computer systems were infected by ransomware. The attacker asked for 1 bitcoin (about $905) for each infected computer, and then used unprotected desktop interface to infect other connected computers from remote. These corps lost several million dollars due to the huge number of infected computers . February 5th 2016, Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center paid a $17,000 ransom in bitcoin to a hacker who seized control of the hospital\u2019s computer systems and would give back access only when the money was paid. Two hospitals in Ottawa and in Ontario were attacked by ransomware later on. In February 2016, several schools\u2019 computer systems were attacked by ransomware. The hacker took control of the intranet and servers, and asked for 20 bitcoin. These school ended up paying the anonymous hacker $8,500 to get their IT systems back. In the mid-February, a new ransomware \u201cLocky\u201d started to spread out via email. 7 out of 10 malicious email attachments delivered Locky in Q2 2016. Once users activated the file attached in the email, their files were encrypted and had to pay the distributor a certain ransom to decrypt these files. May 2016, a series of ransomware attacks on the House of Representatives have led US congress to ban using Yahoo Mail and Google hosted-apps, and warned their members about being caution of Internet security. In October, 2016, 277 ransomware attacks were reported to Government Computer Emergency Response Team in Hong Kong, China.

The issue affected only one Cerber server, not all, and was most likely due to a misconfiguration. The server wasn't a command and control server, but a mere staging server from where the victims' computers would connect and download the actual ransomware, which would later run and infect their PCs. An error in one of the server files (hxxp://truthforeyoue.top/search.php) displayed page source code, instead of executing it. This information found its way to Avast security researcher Jaromir Horejsi, who together with the Avast team leveraged this error to get control over the server. For a period of three hours, the Avast teams explains, they collected information from server logs. The Avast team observed over 700 users download Cerber installers, which ran on their PCs. Extrapolating this number to a whole day, just one typical Cerber ransomware staging server would be able to deliver payloads to around 8,400 users during a spam run peak or malvertising campaigns.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: collected, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The bug, which was first spotted by researchers at\u00a0Check Point, is caused by a development oversight in Android permissions, which in the past required users to manually grant downloaded applications the ability to display content on top of other app panes. However following complaints from users who found it difficult to manually whitelist each app, the Android 6.0.1 'Marshmallow' update made this process automatic, which was good news for legitimate apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It appears that fix has meant apps hiding malicious codes are able to bypass security also being automatically granted the same access, specifically the 'SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW' permission. According to Google's own statistics, the vulnerability will be active on close to\u00a040 percent of all Android devices.\u00a0 \"As a temporary solution, Google applied a patch in Android version 6.0.1 that allows the Play Store app to grant run-time permissions, which are later used to grant SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission to apps installed from the app store,\" the Check Point research team explained in a\u00a0blog post. \"This means that a malicious app downloaded directly from the app store will be automatically granted this dangerous permission.\" This permission is particularly dangerous as it allows an app to display over any other app, without notifying the user. This means apps are able to display fraudulent adverts or links to content hosting malicious code, which are heavily used in banking Trojans. \"It can also be used by ransomware to create a persistent on-top screen that will prevent non-technical users from accessing their devices,\" explained the team. This particular permissions exploit is used by 74 percent of all ransomware, 57 percent of adware and 14 percent of banker malware, according to the report, clearly demonstrating that this is a widespread tactic in the wild. What's worrying is that Google has stated that a fix will be available in time for\u00a0the release of Android O, which isn't expected until late summer.

Popular open source forum software suffers from vulnerabilities that could let an attacker gain access to user accounts, carry out web-cache poisoning attacks, and in some instances, execute arbitrary code. Legal Hackers\u2018 Dawid Golunski found the vulnerabilities, a host header injection and an unauthorized remote code execution vulnerability\u2013in software which is developed by Vanilla Forums. Golunski reported the issues to Vanilla Forums in January and while a support team acknowledged his reports, he\u2019s experienced five months of silence from the company since, something that prompted him to finally disclose the vulnerabilities Thursday via his ExploitBox.io service. The researcher confirmed the vulnerabilities exist in the most recent, stable version (2.3) of Vanilla Forums. He presumes older versions of the forum software are also vulnerable. When reached Thursday, Lincoln Russell, a senior developer at Vanilla Forums stressed the vulnerabilities, which are in the middle of being fixed, only affect the company\u2019s free and open source product. Golunski says the most concerning vulnerability, the RCE (CVE-2016-10033) stems from a PHPMailer vulnerability he disclosed last December. An attacker could remotely exploit the same vulnerability in Vanilla Forums by sending a web request in which a payload is passed within the HOST header. Until a fix is pushed Golunski is encouraging users to preset the sender\u2019s support email address to a static value to prevent the dynamic creation of an email address, or the use of the HOST header, as a temporary mitigation. Golunski says the second issue, the host header injection vulnerability (CVE-2016-10073) also affects version 2.3 of the software. The issue stems from the fact that the forum software uses user-supplied HTTP HOST header when sending emails from the host on which the forum was installed. That means an attacker could use HTTP HOST header to set the email domain to an arbitrary host. It would require user interaction but if exploited, it\u2019s possible the bug could help an attacker intercept a password reset hash and gain access to a victim\u2019s account.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: suffers, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: suffers, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: acknowledged his reports, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclose, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: confirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exist in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: presumes, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: being fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affect, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: says, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: could remotely exploit, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is pushed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: says, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affects, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: intercept, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: gain access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

It\u2019s possible the vulnerability could also lead to web-cache poisoning if the HOST header is used to form links in web responses Golunski says.

According to Heimdal Security, it\u2019s been targeting the old versions of popular applications such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge, or Flash, in order to distribute the Cerber ransomware. The campaign involves a number of malicious domains to launch drive-by attacks against unsuspecting visitors and relies on their failure to update applications regularly. Nevertheless, according to Heimdal Security, just the outdated versions of Internet Explorer, Silverlight, Flash Player, and Microsoft Edge are targeted. Heimdal Security also claims that RIG attempts to exploit one of 8 vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer, Silverlight, Flash Player, and Microsoft Edge, including CVE-2015-8651 (CVSS Score: 9.1), CVE-2015-5122 (CVSS Score: 10, affects nearly 100 Flash versions), CVE-2016-4117 (CVSS Score: 10), CVE-2016-1019 (CVSS Score: 10), CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201 (both CVSS Score: 7.6, affecting Microsoft Edge), CVE-2016-3298 (CVSS Score: 3.6, affects Internet Explorer versions 9, 10, 11), and CVE-2016-0034 (CVSS Score: 9.3).

Romanian group Bitdefender is a global technology security company which provides cyber security solutions to more than 500 million users across businesses and homes in more than 150 countries. \u201cThe WannaCry 1.0 and 2.0 versions, a type of fast-spreading ransomware that blocks the data of the users and then asks for a ransom, are only the beginning in a series of similar, ample attacks, making WannaCry one of the most significant IT threats of the next 12 months. The amplitude of the WannaCry phenomenon can be reduced rapidly if Microsoft decides to push an update to all users who do not use the most recent version of the Windows operating system. This measure has been taken before, and the reach of the WannaCry threat could justify this again, in a controlled and coordinated method, with the support of authorities and of cyber-security companies. Although the measure of updating without the user\u2019s permission would force the limits of current legislation, the Bitdefender expertise in cyber-security has proven that, many times, current regulations do not keep up with the evolution of the criminal phenomenon. This is why cooperation between authorities and the IT security industry is more needed than ever,\u201d Co\u0219oi explained. The computers in public institutions, hospitals, and other social sector organizations are not usually updated with the most recent OS system, the Bitdefender representative said. \u201cIf the respective terminals are not infected by ransomware now, they will remain vulnerable to other threats, including cyber-attacks sponsored by other states.

As a new cyberattack continues to sweep across the globe, the company is once again at the center of the debate over who is to blame for a vicious strain of malware demanding ransom from victims in exchange for the unlocking of their digital files. This time, though, Microsoft believes others should share responsibility for the attack, an assault that targeted flaws in the Windows operating system. On Sunday, Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s president and chief legal officer, wrote a blog post describing the company\u2019s efforts to stop the ransomware\u2019s spread, including an unusual step it took to release a security update for versions of Windows that Microsoft no longer supports. Mr. Smith wrote, \u201cAs a technology company, we at Microsoft have the first responsibility to address these issues.\u201d He went on, though, to emphasize that the attack had demonstrated the \u201cdegree to which cybersecurity has become a shared responsibility between tech companies and customers,\u201d the latter of whom must update their systems if they want to be protected. He also pointed his finger at intelligence services, since the latest vulnerability appeared to have been leaked from the National Security Agency. On Monday, a Microsoft spokesman declined to comment beyond Mr. Smith\u2019s post.  Microsoft has recognized the risk that cybersecurity poses to it since about 2002, when Bill Gates, the former chief executive, issued a call to arms inside the company after a wave of malicious software began infecting Windows PCs connected to the internet. \u201cAs software has become ever more complex, interdependent and interconnected, our reputation as a company has in turn become more vulnerable,\u201d Mr. Gates wrote in an email to employees identifying trustworthy computing as Microsoft\u2019s top priority. \u201cFlaws in a single Microsoft product, service or policy not only affect the quality of our platform and services overall, but also our customers\u2019 view of us as a company.\u201d Since then, the company has poured billions of dollars into security initiatives, employing more than 3,500 engineers dedicated to security.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: demanding ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: release, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: affect, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

The WannaCry worm has affected more than 200,000 Windows computers around the world since Friday, disrupting car factories, global shipper FedEx Corp and Britain's National Health Service, among others. The hacking tool spreads silently between computers, shutting them down by encrypting data and then demanding a ransom of US$300 to unlock them. According to Microsoft, computers affected by the ransomware did not have security patches for various Windows versions installed or were running Windows XP, which the company no longer supports. \"Using outdated versions of Windows that are no longer supported raises a lot of questions,\" said Christopher Dore, a lawyer specializing in digital privacy law at Edelson PC. \"It would arguably be knowingly negligent to let those systems stay in place.\u201d Businesses could face legal claims if they failed to deliver services because of the attack, said Edward McAndrew, a data privacy lawyer at Ballard Spahr. \"There is this stream of liability that flows from the ransomware attack,\" he said  \"That's liability to individuals, consumers and patients,\" WannaCry exploits a vulnerability in older versions of Windows, including Windows 7 and Windows XP. Microsoft issued a security update in March that stops WannaCry and other malware in Windows 7. Over the weekend the company took the unusual step of releasing a similar patch for Windows XP, which the company announced in 2014 it would no longer support. Dore said companies that faced disruptions because they did not run the Microsoft update or because they were using older versions of Windows could face lawsuits if they publicly touted their cyber security. His law firm sued LinkedIn after a 2012 data breach, alleging individuals paid for premium accounts because the company falsely stated it had top-quality cyber security measures. LinkedIn settled for US$1.25 million in 2014. But Scott Vernick, a data security lawyer at Fox Rothschild that represents companies, said he was sceptical that WannaCry would produce a flood of consumer lawsuits. He noted there was no indication the cyber attack had resulted in widespread disclosure of personal data. \"It isn\u2019t clear that there has been a harm to consumers,\" he said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: disrupting, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: exploits, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: releasing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Microsoft itself is unlikely to face legal trouble over the flaw in Windows being exploited by WannaCry, according to legal experts. When Microsoft sells software it does so through a licensing agreement that states the company is not liable for any security breaches, said Michael Scott, a professor at Southwestern Law School. Courts have consistently upheld those agreements, he said. Alex Abdo, a staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said Microsoft and other software companies have strategically settled lawsuits that could lead to court rulings weakening their licensing agreements. \"This area of law has been stunted in its growth,\" he said. \"It is very difficult to hold software manufacturers accountable for flaws in their products.\" Also enjoying strong protection from liability over the cyber attack is the US National Security Agency, whose stolen hacking tool is believed to be the basis for WannaCry. The NSA did not immediately return a request for comment. Jonathan Zittrain, a professor specializing in internet law at Harvard Law School, said courts have frequently dismissed lawsuits against the agency on the grounds they might result in the disclosure of top secret information. On top of that, the NSA would likely be able to claim that it is shielded from liability under the doctrine of sovereign immunity, which says that the government cannot be sued over carrying out its official duties. \"I doubt there can be any liability that stems back to the NSA,\" Dore said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: being exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

On Friday, May 12, a new ransomware, called WannaCry, began circulating throughout the United Kingdom and Spain, rapidly infecting over 45,000 exposed servers at healthcare, financial, and other business sectors. This ransomware stood out for several reasons, including being the largest ransomware attack in history, and the first widely spread ransomware worm. The ransomware infection is Version 2.0 of WanaCypt0r (also known as WCry, WannaCry, and WannaCryptor). Unlike previous instances, this version takes advantage of the SMB vulnerability outlined in Microsoft Security Bulletin (MS17-010). This vulnerability was first exploited by the ETERNALBLUE malware, revealed by the ShadowBrokers leak in March, and targeted the Microsoft MS17-010 SMB vulnerabilities. SMB (Server Message Block) is a protocol primarily communicating on port 445 and is designed to provide access to shared resources on a network. Last fall, Microsoft propounded system administrators to disable SMB Version 1 on systems. According to a FBI FLASH Alert (TLP:White) received by Recorded Future, the WannaCry ransomware infects initial endpoints via a phishing campaign or compromised RDP (remote desktop protocol). Once the ransomware gets into a network, it spreads quickly through any computers that don\u2019t have the patch applied. The worm-like capabilities are the new feature added to this ransomware. During the May 12 attack, two of the most significant targets were Telefonica, the Spanish telecommunications giant, and the United Kingdom\u2019s National Health Service. In the United States, the shipping firm FedEx was hit by the ransomware. Infections of the new version of WannaCry started in Spain early on May 12, but quickly spread to the United Kingdom, Russia, Japan, Taiwan, the United States, and many more. In total, almost 100 countries were affected by the attack. New instances of this ransomware worm dramatically decreased following the activation of a \u201ckill-switch\u201d in the ransomware.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransomware worm attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the ShadowBrokers leak, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

WannaCry checked to ensure non-registration of the domain at some point prior to infection. According to the researcher, this was likely intended as a way to prevent analysis of the malware in a sandbox. If the domain is registered, WannaCry exits the system, preventing further infection. While this doesn\u2019t benefit victims already infected, it does curb further infection. Additionally, according to security researcher Didier Stevens, WannaCry isn\u2019t proxy aware, so enterprises utilizing a proxy won\u2019t benefit from the \u201ckill-switch.\u201d Spora ransomware, which began circulating in January of this year, is a ransomware noted for its sophistication, including top-notch customer support to victims, and was likely created by professional malicious actors. Research in Recorded Future identified an early warning bulletin on WannaCry published on May 5, 2017 by the Spanish CERTSI (Computer Emergency Response Team for Security and Industry). The CERTSI bulletin cited numerous ransomware attacks using WannaCry targeting on equipment. It appears Russian cyber criminals were equally perplexed by the WCry campaign as the rest of the world. One of the members of the popular underground community complained about the recently purchased Virtual Private Server (VPS) which was almost immediately infected by ransomware even before the system update was completed. At least three separate Bitcoin wallets, controlled by unknown criminals were identified as part of the ransomware campaign. As of this writing, little over 15 Bitcoins or approximately $26,000 were deposited to wallets controlled by unknown criminals. In the Reference section of the WCry Intel Card, we see this factsheet posted towards a GitHub page where security researcher Mark Lee helpfully wrote a running compilation of information on WannaCry ransomware.

Its ability to spread like a worm by exploiting a Microsoft vulnerability was certainly new ground for a ransomware campaign. But along the way, there\u2019s been a lot of fear and hype. Perspective is in order. Here\u2019s a look at the latest in Sophos\u2019 investigation, including a recap of how it is protecting customers. From there, we look at how this fits into overall attack trends and how, in the grand scheme of things, this doesn\u2019t represent a falling sky. With the code behind Friday\u2019s attack in the wild, we should\u00a0expect copycats to cook up their own campaigns\u00a0in the coming days\u00a0to capitalize on the money-making opportunity in front of them. Over the weekend, accounts set up to collect ransom payments had received smaller amounts than expected for an attack of this size. But by Monday morning, the balances were on the rise, suggesting that more people were responding to the ransom message Monday. On Saturday, three ransomware-associated wallets had received 92 bitcoin payments totaling $26,407.85 USD. By Sunday, the number between the three wallets was up to $30,706.61 USD. By Monday morning, 181 payments had been made totaling 29.46564365 BTC ($50,504.23 USD). Analysis seems to confirm that Friday\u2019s attack was launched using suspected NSA code leaked by a group of hackers known as the Shadow Brokers. It used a variant of the Shadow Brokers\u2019 APT EternalBlue Exploit (CC-1353), and used strong encryption on files such as documents, images, and videos. A perfect attack would self-propagate but would do so slowly, randomly and unpredictably. This one was full throttle, but hardly to its detriment. Here we had something that spread like wildfire, but the machines that were impacted were probably still susceptible to secondary attacks because the underlying vulnerability probably hasn\u2019t been patched. The problem is that exploit and payload are separate. The payload went fast and got stopped, but that\u2019s just one of an infinite number of possibilities that can spread through the unsolved exploit. Companies still using Windows XP are particularly susceptible to this sort of attack.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: WannaCry ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: were impacted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The global cyber attack that crippled more than hundreds of thousands of computers over 150 countries is poised to swell today. The ransomware employed by hackers, who have demanded Bitcoin payments from the victims, renders files stored on afflicted computers inaccessible completely. A number of large corporations and many hospitals in Britain have been infected with this malware. There have been reports of infections in 150 countries, including the UK, US, China, Russia, Spain, Italy and Taiwan. The US President Donald Trump directed his homeland security adviser to hold meetings on the matter over the weekend.

Luckily, the malware only impacts older versions of Microsoft's operating system -- Windows 10 is not vulnerable. Also immune to WannaCrypt is macOS and Linux distributions. Unfortunately, many people run older versions of Windows, but Microsoft has been very active in issuing patches for them -- including for the now-unsupported XP. Patches aside, security software can protect vulnerable computers too. In fact, today, Symantec announces that it has successfully blocked almost 22 million WannaCrypt\u00a0attacks. The company even leveraged machine learning in its fight against the ransomware. The company\u00a0explains that it, \"blocked nearly 22 million WannaCry infection attempts across 300,000 endpoints, providing full protection for Symantec customers through its advanced exploit protection technology. The WannaCry ransomware attacks targeted and affected users in various countries across the globe by encrypting data files on infected computers and demanding users pay a $300USD ransom in bitcoin to decrypt their files. The protection of Symantec customers was enabled in part due to the integration of real-time threat intelligence shared across both Symantec Endpoint Protection and the Blue Coat ProxySG, which provided real-time threat awareness across the endpoint, network and cloud.\" Mike Fey, president and chief operating officer at Symantec explains, \"The WannaCry ransomware attack is the largest we've ever seen of its kind and we're pleased to share that Symantec customers benefited from multiple layers of protection even before it happened, through innovations and new capabilities in our Integrated Cyber Defense Platform. Our proactive network protection and advanced machine learning technologies provided real-time, zero-day, protection for all SEP and Norton customers when WannaCry was released last week. And, our Global Intelligence Network automatically shares WannaCry intelligence between Symantec endpoint, email and Blue Coat network products, providing full protection across all control points, including the cloud.\" While Symantec's announcement\u00a0highlights the importance of security software for both home and business users, it shouldn't distract from the fact that it is also imperative to apply\u00a0operating system updates in a timely matter.

The massive scope and potential financial impact of the WannaCry attack has understandably caused a lot of panic, and companies and individuals alike have been rushing to protect their devices.\u00a0 However, this frenzy has opened up new damaging routes for fraud.

However, as the world returned to the office on Monday, those payments have been rapidly mounting, based on tracking data for the three Bitcoin wallets tied by researchers to the malware. As of noon Eastern Time on Monday, payments had reached an estimated $71,000 since May 12. So far, 263 payments have been made to the three wallets linked to the code in the malware. The payment history for each wallet shows individual transactions ranging mostly between 0.16 and 0.34 Bitcoin (approximately $300 and $600, respectively), with the number of larger payments increasing over time. Different ransom amounts have been presented to victims, and the price of Bitcoin has climbed dramatically over the past week, causing some variation in the payment sizes. According to researchers at Symantec Security Response, tracking ransom transactions would have been much more difficult if not for a bug in code that was supposed to create an individual bitcoin wallet for each victim: #WannaCry has code to provide unique bitcoin address for each victim but defaults to hardcoded addresses as a result of race condition bug \u2014 Security Response (@threatintel) May 16, 2017 Because the code failed, it defaulted over the three preset wallets.

On 17 May, Softpedia's Gabriela Vatu reported that two copies of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales had appeared on the popular (and somewhat appropriate) BitTorrent site The Pirate Bay. \"According to the information unearthed thus far, the hackers managed to get access to the systems of Larson Studios in Hollywood, a company that handles additional dialogue recorded for movies. It seems that the copies they've managed to get their hands on are in various stages of production and not exactly what you'd expect from a full cinema-ready release.\" News of the extortion attempt first appeared in The Hollywood Reporter on 15 May when Bob\u00a0Iger, CEO at Walt Disney, revealed the hackers had demanded that Disney pay a \"huge sum\" in Bitcoins to prevent them from leaking a then-undisclosed movie online. At the time, the attackers said they would release the film incrementally to netizens, first publishing clips lasting only a few minutes and slowly building up to 20-minute segments. Iger said Disney decided to not pay the attackers and was working with federal law enforcement to investigate the theft of one of its productions. It's unclear who exactly perpetrated the leak - if indeed the files really are of the movie. Even so, a potential candidate is The Dark Overlord, a group of hackers who released the fifth season of Orange Is the New Black after Netflix refused to meet its ransom demands back in April 2017. Around that time, the hacking gang, which has also extorted non-film entities in the past, tweeted out that it had stolen content from a number of other media companies. It did not name Walt Disney by name, though it did point to FOX, ABC, and others. Who is next on the list? FOX, IFC, NAT GEO, and ABC. Oh, what fun we're all going to have. We're not playing any games anymore. While Disney and Netflix continue to work with the FBI in tracking down The Dark Overlord, someone has already removed the two copies of what claimed to be the Pirates of the Caribbean film from The Pirate Bay.

Kaspersky Lab, a cybersecurity and antivirus provider in Moscow, said in a statement that a security researcher at Google found an \u201cartifact\u201d on Twitter potentially linking the WannaCry ransomware attacks that hit organizations and individuals in several dozen countries and the Lazarus hacking group which was responsible for several devastating cyberattacks on government organizations, media firms and financial institutions in recent years. \u201cOn Monday, May 15, a security researcher from Google posted an artifact on Twitter potentially pointing at a connection between the WannaCry ransomware attacks that recently hit thousands of organizations and private users around the world, and the malware attributed to the infamous Lazarus hacking group, responsible for a series of devastating attacks against government organizations, media and financial institutions,\u201d Kaspersky said. Late last week, a worm dubbed WannaCry locked up more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, disrupting operations of car factories, hospitals, shops, schools and other institutions. The attack on late Friday was slowed down after a security researcher took control of a server linked to the attack, crippling its ability to rapidly spread across the world. The Lazarus group meanwhile has been linked to several large-scale operations such as the attacks against Sony Pictures in 2014 and a series of similar attacks that continued until 2017. One of the biggest attacks carried out by the Lazarus group was the Central Bank of Bangladesh heist in 2016, one of the biggest in history. In that operation, hackers sent fraudulent messages that were made to appear to be from the Bangladeshi central bank to transfer $1 billion from its account in the Federal Reserve of New York. Most of the transfers were blocked but about $81 million was sent to RCBC in the Philippines. The money was moved around to make it difficult to trace. Kaspersky said that the Google researcher pointed at a WannaCry malware sample which appeared in February 2017, weeks before the late Friday attack. Based on the analysis of Kaspersky researchers, it was confirmed that there was \u201cclear code similarities\u201d between the sample highlighted by the Google expert and the malware samples used by the Lazarus group in their 2015 attacks.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: WannaCry\u00a0ransomware\u00a0attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: WannaCry ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: WannaCry ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: disrupting, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: sent, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: appear to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Muslim focused site PureMatrimony.com says it has informed its users of an apparent data breach, and asked them to reset their passwords.  \"Looking for a practising single Muslim? Look no further. We have over 100,000 members,\" PureMatrimony.com reads. Apart from a focus on a specific demographic, Pure Matrimony works very much like any other dating site, and has a free sign up process.  Motherboard obtained a list of some 120,000 hashes\u2014a string of characters that can represent a user's password\u2014that were dumped on a password cracking forum, and that appear to relate to Pure Matrimony. They were hashed with the weak MD5 algorithm, meaning that hackers could likely obtain many real passwords from them.  Indeed, several users on the forum had seemingly successfully cracked a number of the hashes. Many of the hashes, when translated to plaintext versions, read \"purematrimony,\" or \"purematrimony1,\" for example. The posted data did not include any other account information, such as email addresses or usernames.  \"Customers have already been notified of the incident via email,\" a Pure Matrimony representative told Motherboard in an email. \"Customers have been notified to change their passwords on their profile accounts as well as any other places online where they may have used the same password.\" The company claimed that Pure Matrimony's site had not been hacked, but believes a vulnerability in a third party service provider may be to blame. Motherboard could not independently verify this claim.  \"Our team have taken advice from two separate independent security consultants to ensure that we are doing everything possible to secure our data and protect our members. Aside from the additional security measures and moving our website to a new server, we have informed members and also logged this with the ICO [the UK's Information Commissioner's Office, which upholds data protection in the country],\" the representative added.  Last year, Motherboard reported on a data breach of another Muslim dating site, Muslim Match. In that case, hackers managed to grab the full content of messages between members.   The lesson: As Pure Matrimony advises, users should change their passwords, and especially on sites where they used the same login details.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were dumped, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: obtain, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: grab, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

That scam implied that WhatsApp itself was making the offer in order to keep you active on WhatsApp without using any airtime or data from your own mobile provider network. It was all a pack of lies, of course, as became obvious if you clicked through to the various links seen in the scam campaign. When we used an old-model iPhone, we were bait-and-switched to what was supposedly a lucky draw in which we could allegedly win a brand new iPhone \u2013 in return for forwarding the original scam to four of our friends and four groups of friends: We didn\u2019t do that, of course, so we can\u2019t tell you what we would have had to do next to qualify for entry into the \u201cprize draw\u201d, but most scams of this sort involve getting you to fill in one or more surveys, in which you hand over personal information such as email address, phone number and often your physical address. The excuse that \u201cwe need to know how to contact you and where to deliver the prize if you win\u201d is sometimes used as an incentive to squeeze you into giving away information that you might otherwise refuse to reveal to strangers. Watch out for competitions that do this: if the only purpose of collecting the data is to deal with one winner out of all the entrants, why not wait until the winner is known and ask just that person? When we played along with the WhatsApp scam from an Android device, we had to forward the scam to 15 friends and install two apps: The suggestion to \u201cPlease Download Both Apps below to Enable Ultra Wifi\u201d did no such thing: one app was the front-end for an Android software marketplace catering to users in India; the other was a shopping app for a popular Chinese web service. The apps were legitimate, and unconnected with the scam except that the crooks selected them as baits to try to rack up fraudulent pay-per-install affiliate fees. The \u201cfree Wi-Fi\u201d never materialised, of course, because it was a fabrication from the start. Over the past weekend, several Naked Security readers in the UK alerted us to a similar sort of WhatsApp scam, this time stealing the brands of at least two major UK supermarket chains.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a fast-spreading WhatsApp scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: That scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: the scam campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were bait-and-switched, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: the WhatsApp scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: as baits, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: WhatsApp scam, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

A case in point is a dangerous phishing technique targeting Gmail users that first surfaced about one year ago but has begun gaining steam in recent weeks. Wordfence, the maker of a security plugin for Wordpress,\u00a0described the phishing attack as beginning with an adversary sending an email to a target\u2019s Gmail account. The email typically will originate from someone on the recipient\u2019s contact list whose own account had previously been compromised. The email comes with a subject header and a screenshot or image of an attachment that the sender has used in a recent communication with the recipient. When the recipient clicks on the image, a new tab opens with a prompt asking the user to sign into Gmail again. The fully functional phishing page is designed to look exactly like Google\u2019s page for signing into Gmail. The address bar for the page includes mention of accounts.google.com,\u00a0leading unwary users to believe the page is harmless, Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder wrote. \"Once you complete\u00a0sign-in, your account has been compromised,\" he said. In reality, the fake login page that opens up when a user clicks on the image is actually an inline file created using a scheme called Data URI. When users enter their Gmail username and password on the page, the data is sent to the attacker. The speed at which the attackers sign into a compromised account suggest that the process may be automated, or that they may have a team standing by to access accounts as they get compromised. \"Once they have access to your account, the\u00a0attacker also has full access to all your emails including sent and received at this point and may\u00a0download the whole lot,\" Maunder said. What makes the phishing technique dangerous is the way the address bar displays information when users click on the screenshot of the attachment, he told Dark Reading. In this case, by including the correct host name and \u201chttps//\u201d in the address bar, the attackers appear to be having more success fooling victims into entering their credential data on the fake Gmail login page, he says. Instead, all of the content in the address bar is of the same color and is designed to convince users that the site is harmless.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: the phishing attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sending, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: designed to look exactly like, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: opens up, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: displays, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: appear to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: fooling, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Researcher Pedro Ribeiro of Agile Information Security found accessible admin accounts and command injection vulnerabilities in ZyXel and Billion routers distributed by TrueOnline, Thailand\u2019s largest broadband company. Ribeiro said he disclosed the vulnerabilities through Beyond Security\u2019s SecuriTeam Secure Disclosure Program, which contacted the affected vendors last July. Ribeiro published a proof of concept exploit yesterday as well. Ribeiro told Threatpost he\u2019s unsure whether TrueOnline introduced the vulnerabilities as it adds its own customization to the routers, or whether they came from the respective manufacturers. A ZyXel representative told Threatpost\u00a0the router models are no longer supported and would not comment on whether patches were being developed. A request for comment from Billion was not returned in time for publication. The commonality between the routers appears to be that they\u2019re all based on the TC3162U system-on-a-chip manufactured by TrendChip. Affected routers are the ZyXel P660HN-T v1 and P660HN-T v2, and Billion 5200 W-T, currently in distribution to TrueOnline customers. The TC3162U chips run two different firmware variants, one called \u201cras\u201d which includes the Allegro RomPage webserver vulnerable to the Misfortne Cookie attacks, and the other called tclinux. The tclinux variant contains the vulnerabilities found by Ribeiro, in particular several ASP files, he said, are vulnerable to command injection attacks. He also cautions that they could be also vulnerable to Misfortune Cookie, but he did not investigate this possibility. \u201cIt should be noted that tclinux contains files and configuration settings in other languages (for example in Turkish). Therefore it is likely that these firmware versions are not specific to TrueOnline, and other ISP customised routers in other countries might also be vulnerable,\u201d Ribeiro said in his advisory. \u201cIt is also possible that other brands and router models that use the tclinux variant are also affected by the command injection vulnerabilities (the default accounts are likely to be TrueOnline specific)\u201d.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: were published on, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: private disclosures, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: told, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: introduced, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were being developed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are also affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Most of the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely, some without authentication. \u201cThese vulnerabilities are present in the web interface. The default credentials are part of the firmware deployed by TrueOnline and they are authorized to perform remote access over the WAN,\u201d Ribeiro said. \u201cDue to time and lab constraints I was unable to test whether these routers expose the web interface over the WAN, but given the credentials, it is likely\u201d. The ZyXel P660HN-T v1 router is vulnerable to an unauthenticated command injection attack that can be exploited remotely. Ribeiro said he found the vulnerability in the remote system log forwarding function, specifically in the ViewLog.asp page. V2 of the same router contains the same vulnerability, but cannot be exploited without authentication, he said. \u201cUnlike in the P660HN-Tv1, the injection is authenticated and in the logSet.asp page. However, this router contains a hardcoded supervisor password that can be used to exploit this vulnerability,\u201d Ribeiro said. \u201cThe injection is in the logSet.asp page that sets up remote forwarding of syslog logs, and the parameter vulnerable to injection is the serverIP parameter\u201d. The Billion 5200W-T is also vulnerable to unauthenticated and authenticated command injection attacks; the vulnerability was found in its adv_remotelog.asp page. \u201cThe Billion 5200W-T router also has several other command injections in its interface, depending on the firmware version, such as an authenticated command injection in tools_time.asp (uiViewSNTPServer parameter),\u201d Ribeiro said. It should be noted that this router contains several hardcoded administrative accounts that can be used to exploit this vulnerability\u201d. Ribeiro said default and weak admin credentials were found on the all of the versions and were accessible remotely. The researcher said it\u2019s unknown whether the routers can be patched remotely. \u201cAgain, given the existence of default credentials that have remote access, it is likely that it is possible to update the firmware remotely,\u201d Ribeiro said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: are available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: contains, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is also vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

A study out today from Shape Security shows that it's common for credential-stuffing login attempts to account for more than 90% of all login activity on Internet-facing systems at Fortune 100 firms. \"In working with customers in retail, finance, travel, government, and other industries, Shape has seen millions of instances of credentials from reported breaches being used in credential stuffing attacks,\" the report says. Online-credential breaches that don't expose any other personally identifiable information may seem like no big deal on the spectrum of massive security incidents. But the study out today shows that with automation, attackers are using stolen passwords quite effectively. If attackers have a large enough pool of stolen credentials to try across various other Web systems online, even a very slim success rate can yield them hundreds of thousands - or even millions - of accounts ripe for takeover. Global organizations in 2016 reported more than 3 billion username and password combinations stolen, led first and foremost by Yahoo's massive 1.5 billion user breach. \"Credential spills became a worldwide pandemic in 2016. While we have been observing credential spills and credential-stuffing attacks for many years, the scale of both in 2016 was remarkable,\" says Shuman Ghosemajumder, CTO for Shape. \"The size and frequency of credential spills appears to be increasing, with the record for all-time largest credential spill being reset three times last year.\" Shape reports that in its work with retail, finance, travel, government, and other industries in 2016, it observed millions of credentials exposed from reported breaches being used in credential- stuffing attacks. During one 4-month observation period at a major retailer, for example, Shape Security witnessed 15.5 million account login attempts. Scarily enough, 500,000 accounts at that retailer were on breached credential lists. The difficulty with credential stuffing is that many companies don't have visibility into the volume of automated login traffic they're being hit with because these attacks aren't taking advantage of vulnerabilities per se. They're using the login functionality the way it is supposed to be used, simply scaling up the rate at which the credentials are plugged into the inputs.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: credential-stuffing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: credential- stuffing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

According to Check Point, who recently released a report on December's most active malware families, Locky spam numbers have gone down 81%. Previously, in October, Locky had been ranked as the top malware threat in the world, while now, in December, Locky is not even in the top 10 anymore. The same thing can also be seen in a chart released by Avast. Even if the chart doesn't cover the last ten days, Locky spam numbers have remained at the same low levels as during the holidays. The only tiny trail of activity in the chart above is the Locky ransomware delivered as a second-stage download for Kovter campaigns. Kovter is a click-fraud malware that infects computers and clicks on invisible ads on the user's behalf. This malware has been around for years, and recently, it started distributing a wide range of secondary payloads. In January 2016, Kovter downloaded and installed a proxy client on infected PCs, transforming infected hosts into proxy servers for the ProxyGate web proxy service. This allowed the Kovter gang to make a side profit by routing web traffic through infected PCs, while also earning money from its main activity: click-fraud. In the same month, Kovter also started distributing a version of the Nemucod ransomware, for which Fabian Wosar of Emsisoft had successfully created a decrypter. Disheartened by Wosar's success, the group behind Kovter switched to several ransomware variants in the following months, and eventually settled on renting and distributing Locky starting with October, as part of an affiliate scheme, splitting the ransom payments with the Locky crew. Researchers looking at Locky infections can easily track Locky infections distributed by the Kovter group by the affiliate IDs 23 and 24, found in Locky's configuration file, present on every infected system. PhishMe researchers have recently published a blog post detailing the Kovter spam emails that has been distributing Locky ransomware in the past weeks. At the moment, these spam emails are the only source of Locky infections.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: the ransom payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

According to De Ceukelaire, he can easily identify the cell phone numbers of well-known personalities including top politicians and \u201cFlemish\u201d celebs simply through checking out their Facebook profile.

The game is finally Google Play Store\u00a0official, but its actual release date is yet unknown, and this eagerness is being exploited by criminals. Super Mario Run for iOS Released Nintendo's first official Mario game on mobile was first launched for all iOS devices before Christmas, which has already been downloaded by millions of users and has reached the top 10, despite its $9.99 price tag. However, the game is yet to be launched for Android users, and this gap is getting used well by cyber criminals, as reported by The Express. Warnings on Fake Super Mario Android Apps Recent warnings have been given by security experts for Android users that they should be aware of the apps that falsely claim to be the Super Mario Run for their device. However, such fake downloads end up uncovering an actual mountain of malware instead of the game. Trend Micro Findings on Malicious Apps Security Firm Trend Micro's Researchers have recently found an increasing count of fake Super Mario Run Android apps that claim as the trending game Super Mario Run or other content related to it. Also, some of the apps even made users install unwanted apps in user's device. For example one of the apps had an emulated version of the original Super Mario Bros game. However, it was filled with pop-ups and banner apps when the user tried downloading the app, said Trend Micro.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: claim to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: fake downloads, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claim as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

No one is going to be happy if hackers manage to break into systems and steal away their intellectual property. In the case of companies like Disney, having a $230 million blockbuster like the latest Pirates of the Caribbean movie stolen could prove to be very costly if hackers follow through with their threats to seed their pirated copy of the film on torrent sites, disrupting its official release. But imagine how much more galling it would be to give in to the hackers\u2019 blackmail threats and pay a ransom for the movie not to be leaked online, only to discover later that the extortionists never had a copy of the film in the first place? Earlier this month it was widely reported that Walt Disney\u2019s CEO Bob Iger had been contacted by hackers who were threatening to release one of the studio\u2019s movies onto the internet unless a ransom was paid. Iger didn\u2019t say what movie the hackers claimed to have stolen, but it was widely thought to be the soon to be released \u201cPirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales.\u201d That theory of the hacked movie\u2019s identity certainly gained more momentum when it was reported that torrents had been spotted on Pirate Bay claiming to be the blockbuster starring Johnny Depp, Javier Bardem and Geoffrey Rush.  However, none of those downloadable torrents were confirmed to contain the \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d movie. And in a video interview with Yahoo Finance, Disney\u2019s CEO debunked claims that a movie had ever been stolen: \u201cTo our knowledge we were not hacked. We had a threat of a hack of a movie being stolen. We decided to take it seriously but not react in the manner in which the person who was threatening us had required. We don\u2019t believe that it was real and nothing has happened.\u201d In short, Disney says that it was not accurate that a movie was ever stolen, and it refused to pay the ransom demand to the extortionists. And that, in itself, may be a lesson for other companies to keep a cool head when they receive an extortion demand claiming that intellectual property or sensitive data has been stolen by hackers.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: blackmail, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransom was paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: have stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: been stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: a hack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: being stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: pay the ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: extortion demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: been stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Headquartered in San Francisco, OneLogin provides single sign-on and identity management for cloud-base applications. OneLogin counts among its customers some 2,000 companies in 44 countries, over 300 app vendors and more than 70 software-as-a-service providers. A breach that allowed intruders to decrypt customer data could be extremely damaging for affected customers. After OneLogin customers sign into their account, the service takes care of remembering and supplying\u00a0the customer\u2019s usernames and passwords for all of their other applications. In a brief blog post Wednesday, OneLogin chief information security officer Alvaro Hoyos wrote that the company detected unauthorized access to OneLogin data. \u201cToday we detected unauthorized access to OneLogin data in our US data region.

The hacker announced the breach a few hours ago and also posted proof of his intrusion. According to Cipher0007, the hack took place after he found an SQL injection flaw in the market's database. The hacker claims he used the SQL injection flaw to upload a shell on the market's server. He then used this backdoor to access various parts of the backend and dumped the private key used to generate the market's .onion URL. Cipher0007 also says he used the market's phpMyAdmin installation to dump details on the database configuration and other login information. At the time of writing, the market's phpMyAdmin login page was still exposed to external connections. To prove his claims, the hacker posted online a screengrab while uploading the shell to the Sanctuary market's server, the market's 1024 bit RSA private key, and the market's root account database login information. The Sanctuary market is a small Dark Web market, and one of the few places where digital products such as data dumps, malware, and others, are far more prevalent than drugs and weapons. The admin of the Sanctuary market did not respond to a request for comment from Bleeping Computer in time for this article's publication. Cipher0007 has a reputation in the hacking underground already. In January, the hacker collected an unspecified Bitcoin reward for reporting a bug to the AlphaBay staff that would have allowed an attacker access to over 218,000 private messages.

According to current information, the malware is already distributed and deployed in live attacks, being used to possibly target at least two companies and steal hundreds of GBs of information. According to MalwareHunterTeam and other researchers that have looked at the malware's source code, GhostAdmin seems to be a reworked version of CrimeScene, another botnet malware family that was active around 3-4 years ago. Under the hood, GhostAdmin is written in C# and is already at version 2.0. The malware works by infecting computers, gaining boot persistence, and establishing a communications channel with its command and control (C&C) server, which is an IRC channel. GhostAdmin's authors access to this IRC channel and issue commands that will be picked up by all connected bots (infected computers). The malware can interact with the victim's filesystem, browse to specific URLs, download and execute new files, take screenshots, record audio, enable remote desktop connections, exfiltrate data, delete log files, interact with local databases, wipe browsing history and more. A full list of available commands is available via the image below: The malware's features revolve around the ability to collect data from infected computers and silently send it to a remote server. GhostAdmin operates based on a configuration file. Among the settings stored in this file, there are FTP and email credentials. The FTP credentials are for the server where all the stolen information is uploaded, such as screenshots, audio recordings, keystrokes and more. On the other hand, the email credentials are used to send an email to the GhostAdmin author every time a victim executes his malware, and also send error reports. MalwareHunterTeam says that the GhostAdmin version he analyzed was compiled by a user that used the nickname \"Jarad.\" Like almost all malware authors before him, Jarad managed to infect his own computer. Using the FTP credentials found in the malware's configuration file, MalwareHunterTeam found screenshots of GhostAdmin creator's desktop on the FTP server. Furthermore, the researcher also found on the same server files that appeared to be stolen from GhostAdmin victims.

According to a report by Appthority, more than 1,000 apps it looked at on mobile devices leaked personally identifiable information that included passwords, location, VPN PINs, emails and phone numbers. Appthority Mobile Threat Team called\u00a0the vulnerability HospitalGown and said the culprit behind the threat are\u00a0misconfigured backend storage platforms including Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB and MySQL. \u201cHospitalGown is a vulnerability to data exposure caused, not by any code in the app, but by the app developers\u2019 failure to properly secure the backend servers with which the app communicates,\u201d wrote the authors of the report released Wednesday. According to Seth Hardy, director of security research, the problem is a byproduct of insecure database instillations that made headlines in February. That\u2019s when misconfigured and insecure MongoDB, Hadoop and CouchDB installations became popular extortion targets for hackers who were scanning for vulnerable servers to attack. The weak link in the chain when it comes to HospitalGown are the insecure servers that apps connect to, Hardy\u00a0said. During the course of Appthority\u2019s investigation, it found 21,000 open Elasticsearch servers, revealing more than 43 terabytes of exposed data. In one scenario, the attacker looks for vulnerabilities in the space between the vendor\u2019s mobile application and the app\u2019s server side components, according to researchers. \u201cThe servers for most mobile applications are cloud based and accessible via the Internet, this allows a bad actor to skip the long and potentially many-layered \u2018compromise\u2019 stage of an attack, accessing company data directly from a database that is impossible for the enterprise to see or secure,\u201d they wrote.

While this is a strictly a data security issue, Appthority said, attacks can quickly escalate and personal information could easily be leveraged in a spear phishing attack or brute force attack. In its report, AppThority showed how a mobile VPN app called Pulse Workspace, used by enterprises, government agencies and service providers, leaked data. While Pulse Workspace created an API to secure front-end Elasticsearch access, the backend, and all of the app\u2019s data records, were exposed and leaked Pulse customer data. AppThority notified Pulse Workspace and its customers of the vulnerability, which have since been fixed.  Appthority is careful to point out that of the platforms it examined \u2013 Elasticsearch, Redis, MongoDB, and MySQL \u2013 each had plugins to allow for proper public exposure on the internet. \u201cBest practices on secure data stores is just not being adopted in too many cases,\u201d Hardy said. Elasticsearch, for example, has a bevy of security and data protection capabilities, such as being able to encrypt all the data that\u2019s on the platform. Increasing the risk of HospitalGown type-attacks is that fact that many apps\u00a0Appthority looked at seemed benign in terms of shared user data.

This time though, its chip-and-PIN card readers significantly contained the fallout. Kmart is not saying how many of its 750 stores in the US were affected by the point-of-sale (PoS) malware, but it stressed that no personal data, including names, addresses, Social Security Numbers or email addresses, was stolen. It also talked up its EMV reader implementation. Kmart has EMV-enabled terminals in its stores, forcing customers with chip cards to insert their cards instead of swiping their stripes, which minimized the impact of the infection. Still, as independent researcher Brian Krebs reported, those consumers without chip cards could feel significant effects: \u201cThe malware copies account data stored on the card\u2019s magnetic stripe,\u201d he explained. \u201cArmed with that information, thieves can effectively clone the cards and use them to buy high-priced merchandise from electronics stores and big box retailers.\u201d Several financial institutions flagged the breach to Krebs, indicating that fraud is indeed occurring as a result of the attack, though again, no details are available as to how widespread the impact is. The incident has no relation to previous breaches, the bargain retailer said in an FAQ, noting that it\u2019s confident that it was successful in eradicating any residual traces of malware or persistence left behind by earlier attacks. Instead, its payment systems were infected with malware that Kmart says was \u201cundetectable\u201d by its antivirus protections. \u201cDoes this mean that we may be dealing with an entirely new family of malware or methods of infecting POS terminals, or that the solution they were using was unable to detect the threat?\u201d said Richard Henderson, Global Security Strategist, Absolute, via email. \u201cIf the former, then it will be absolutely critical for Kmart to get information about this attack to other retailers, antivirus companies and network security appliance vendors so that everyone can both look for indicators of compromise inside their own networks and bolster defenses against this new threat.\u201d If a hole was simply found in KMart's defenses, it brings up the need for a defense-in-depth approach, he added.

Once aware of the new malicious code, we quickly removed it and contained the event. We are confident that our customers can safely use their credit and debit cards in our retail stores,\" Howard Riefs, a spokesman for Sears Holding, said in a statement to Patch. The company further explained the risk to its customers. \u201cBased on the forensic investigation, NO PERSONAL identifying information (including names, addresses, social security numbers, and email addresses) was obtained by those criminally responsible. However, we believe certain credit card numbers have been compromised. Nevertheless, in light of our EMV compliant point of sale systems, which rolled out last year, we believe the exposure to cardholder data that can be used to create counterfeit cards is limited,\" it said. The breach was first reported by security website Krebs on Security on May 16. Many small banks and credit unions received complaints about batches of stolen cards, all of which had been used at Kmart locations. The company didn\u2019t reveal\u00a0which of its 735 locations were hit, but did say how the breach occurred. The company\u2019s systems were hit with a malware designed to steal credit card data from point-of-sale devices installed at kiosks. The malware copies credit card information from the card\u2019s magnetic strip, when the cards are swiped at payment kiosks. Using this information, the cards can be cloned and purchases made using these clones would be debited from the credit card user\u2019s account. This not the first time Kmart suffered such a breach. The retail chain had a similar breach in 2014 and had also\u00a0claimed at the time the stolen data did not include customer names, emails addresses and personal information. \"We are actively enhancing our defenses in light of this new form of malware.

It is taking advantage of outdated versions of applications such as Flash, Internet Explorer, or Microsoft Edge to distribute the Cerber ransomware, researchers said. The attack leverages malicious domains to launch drive-by attacks against unsuspecting visitors and preys on their failure to update applications in a timely manner, said Andra Zaharia, a security evangelist at Heimdal Security, in a blog post. As long as they use outdated browsers or plugins that contain known vulnerabilities, they are likely to end up infected with malware. Only outdated versions of Flash Player, Silverlight, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge are the focus of the attack, Zaharia said. RIG exploits one of eight vulnerabilities, including CVE-2015-8651 (CVSS Score: 9.1), CVE-2015-5122 (CVSS Score: 10, affects nearly 100 Flash versions), CVE-2016-4117 (CVSS Score: 10), CVE-2016-1019 (CVSS Score: 10), CVE-2016-7200 and CVE-2016-7201 (both CVSS Score: 7.6, affecting Microsoft Edge), CVE-2016-3298 (CVSS Score: 3.6, affects Internet Explorer versions 9, 10, 11), and CVE-2016-0034 (CVSS Score: 9.3). After compromising a user\u2019s computer, the exploit kit proceeds to downloading and installing the Cerber ransomware, one of the most prolific threats last year.

There was controversy earlier this month when news broke about how Adobe took the opportunity on Patch Tuesday of using its regular security updates to force Adobe Acrobat DC users into silently installing a Google Chrome extension. As Bleeping Computer reports, most people first found out about the extension, which offers the ability to easily convert webpages into PDF files, when they saw a prompt asking them to approve the following permissions: Of course, you could choose to remove the extension, but it\u2019s the \u201cEnable\u201d option which is set by default \u2013 and it is probably what many people would click on without thinking of the possible consequences. Users expressed their outrage on social media about Adobe silently installing the Windows-only extension, leaving poor reviews in the Chrome web store: \u201cHow DARE Adobe install this extension automatically and silently as part of a \u2018security\u2019 update for Acrobat. Not only am I removing the extension from the browser, I am permanently removing Acrobat from ALL systems on my network and blocking any further installations. My school district will be Acrobat free AS SOON AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE. Further, I will recommend to the Department of Education a different solution for PDF viewing and editing. I will push and fight to get as many people as I can to stop using this disgusting trash\u201d. What further upset some users was that the Adobe Acrobat Chrome extension sends \u201canonymous product usage data\u201d back to Adobe, although the company stresses that it does not receive details of the URLs visited by users. It wasn\u2019t long before headlines appeared comparing the sneakily-installed extension to \u201cspyware\u201d. Well, perhaps\u2026 Controversial Google security researcher Tavis Ormandy\u2019s interest was piqued by all of the attention being given to the extension, so he made his own examination of its code and found that it was vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. According to statistics displayed on the Chrome web store, the controversial extension has tens of millions of users \u2013 all of whom are potentially vulnerable because of the flaw in its code.

WannaCry targeted a Server Message Block (SMB) critical vulnerability that Microsoft patched with MS17-010 on March 14, 2017. While WannaCry damage was mostly limited to machines running Windows 7, a different version of EternalBlue could infect Windows 10. Researchers at RiskSense stripped the original leaked version of EternalBlue down to its essential components and deemed parts of the data unnecessary for exploitation. They found they could bypass detection rules recommended by governments and antivirus vendors, says RiskSense senior security researcher Sean Dillon. This version of EternalBlue, an exploit initially released by Shadow Brokers earlier this year, does not use the DoublePulsar payload common among other exploits leaked by the hacker group. DoublePulsar was the main implant used in WannaCry and a key focus for defenders. \"That backdoor is unnecessary,\" says Dillon, noting how it's dangerous for businesses to only focus on DoublePulsar malware. \"This exploit could directly load malware onto the system without needing to install the backdoor.\" EternalBlue gives instant un-credentialed remote access to Windows machines without the MS17-010 patch update. While it's difficult to port EternalBlue to additional versions of Windows, it's not impossible. Unpatched Windows 10 machines are at risk, despite the fact that Microsoft's newest OS receives exploit mitigations that earlier versions don't. The slimmed-down EternalBlue can be ported to unpatched versions of Windows 10 and deliver stealthier payloads. An advanced malware would be able to target any Windows machine, broadening the spread of an attack like WannaCry, Dillon explains. It's worth noting WannaCry was a blatant, obvious attack, he says, and other types of malware, like banking spyware and bitcoin miners, could more easily fly under the radar. \"These can infect a network and you won't know about it until years later,\" he says. \"It's a threat to organizations that have been targets, like governments and corporations. Attackers may try to get onto these networks and lay dormant \u2026 then steal intellectual property or cause other damage.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: WannaCry ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: WannaCry damage, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: WannaCry, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The company published investigation results that found nearly 43 TB of enterprise data was exposed on cloud back-ends, including personally identifiable information (PII). This comes just shortly after a similar report from a different security company. In the new \"2017 Q2 Enterprise Mobile Threat Report\" report (free upon providing registration info), Appthority found \"data leakage\" from mobile apps that send data to unsecured cloud back-ends. While security concerns typically focus on a triad of other factors -- apps, device threats and network threats -- this data leakage on the back-end was dubbed the \"HospitalGown\" threat because of that garment's open back-end.  \"In total, we found almost 43 TB of data exposed and 1,000 apps affected by the HospitalGown vulnerability,\" Appthority said in a blog post last week. \"Looking at a subset of 39 apps, we still found 280 million records exposed, a total of about 163 GB of data. This is a staggering amount of leaked information, and in some cases represents the entirety of customer or operational data for an enterprise.\" The report echoes the findings of an earlier report by RedLock Inc., which revealed many security issues primarily caused by user misconfigurations on public cloud platforms. RedLock claimed it found 82 percent of hosted databases remain unencrypted, among many other problems. As with the RedLock report, developers were blamed for the HospitalGown vulnerabilities. \" HospitalGown is a vulnerability to data exposure caused, not by any code in the app, but by the app developers' failure to properly secure the back-end (hence its name) servers with which the app communicates and where sensitive data is stored,\" Appthority said.  Unsecured Elasticsearch servers and MongoDB databases were prime targets of a series of ransomware attacks earlier this year that generated widespread publicity in the security field. However, that publicity apparently wasn't enough to significantly alleviate the issue. \"As our findings show, weakly secured back-ends in apps used by employees, partners and customers create a range of security risks including extensive data leaks of personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive data,\" the report states.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: being blamed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data leakage, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data leakage, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: were blamed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: data leaks, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

And, HospitalGown makes data access and exfiltration far easier than other types of attacks.\"  Key findings of the report as listed by the company include:     Affected apps are connecting to unsecured data stores on popular enterprise services, such as Elasticsearch and MySQL, which are leaking large amounts of sensitive data.     Apps using just one of these services revealed almost 43TB of exposed data.     Multiple affected apps leaked some form of PII, including passwords, location, travel and payment details, corporate profile data (including employees' VPN PINs, emails, phone numbers), and retail customer data.     Enterprise security teams do not have visibility into the risk due to the risk's location in the mobile app vendor's architecture stack.     In multiple cases, data has already been accessed by unauthorized individuals and ransomed.     Even apps that have been removed from devices and the app stores still pose an exposure risk due to the sensitive data that remains stored on unsecured servers. The company said its Mobile Threat Team identified the HospitalGown vulnerabilities with a combination of its dynamic app analysis tool and a new back-end scanning method, looking at the network traffic on more than 1 million enterprise mobile apps, both iOS and Android. As with the misconfiguration problems identified in the RedLock report, Appthority emphasized that all cases of HospitalGown vulnerabilities were caused by human errors, not malicious intent or inherent infrastructure problems. That human error was especially prevalent in two app implementations investigated by Appthority: Pulse Workspace (for accessing enterprise network and Web applications) and Jacto apps (from an agricultural machinery company).[/INST]\n\nTrigger: spear phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: data access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exfiltration, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: are leaking, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: been accessed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransomed, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: exposure, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: identified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: identified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: emphasized, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

They can do so using a malware named xLED, as\u00a0reported\u00a0by JPost. The Cyber Security Research Center at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negvu which is located in Israel have come up with a way to hack into a user\u2019s computer and steal vital data in the form of LED lights that are displayed on a router. Essentially, the operation would require a specially crafted malware named xLED which will need to be installed on a router in order to hack a victim. That is, the router needs to have a security flaw so as to allow the hacker to install the malware in the first place. It can also be possible if a flawed firmware has been installed in the router, thus making it easier for the attacker to break through the device. Once the malware is installed, the data can be exfiltrated in the binary form represented by the blinking of lights. Hence, when the light is off, it will represent a zero while when it is on, it will represent a one. A video recording device can be used to capture the blinking pattern and utilized to steal vital information that is being transmitted through the router. The device can be anything from a recording drone to a CCTV camera. As long as the camera captures the blinking lights, the data being transmitted can be easily stolen. The researchers indicated that since the rate of exfiltration of data depends upon the number of LEDs being present on a router, it goes without saying that the more number of LEDs on a router, the more amount of data can be exfiltrated at any one time. Furthermore, the researchers tested various video-recording setups to see which is the most efficient and found out that the method involving Optical Sensors was the best. This is because it received data at a higher rate and was able to sample the LED lights more quickly than any other methods. Primarily, a data exfiltration rate of 1000 bit/sec per LED was achieved using Optical Sensors. Although the researchers indicated that the method is the most effective one to steal a large amount of data, they, however, stated that since the method involves installing malware on a router, a number of other techniques can be used to extract data anyway.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: extract, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exfiltrated, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exfiltration, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exfiltrated, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data exfiltration, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: extract, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The statement suggests that the individual or individuals in question are holding the developer ransom for an undisclosed figure, threatening to release the early game files out into the public if their demands are not met.  CD Projekt Red has made it clear that it will not meet the hacker(s) demands, and that \"the appropriate legal authorities will be informed about the situation\". Motherboard reached out for a comment from the developer, which said: \"This is real. The tweet is all we have to say.\"  However, it's hard not to remain skeptical still, since E3\u2014the annual industry event where many developers choose to first reveal their games\u2014is just around the corner, and revealing a game called  Cyberpunk 2077 via some kind of elaborate, fake hack, would be a fitting stunt.  For what it's worth, we have not seen any game assets floating around pastebin or in the online circles where stuff like this is usually dumped.  Whether it was planning to or not for E3, this means that we are likely to see content for  Cyberpunk 2077 arrive in the near future, though CD Projekt Red has made it clear that anything released from the hackers is not \"representative of the current vision of the game.\"   Cyberpunk 2077 is an open-world sci-fi RPG and, announced way back in 2012, but doesn't have a release date at this point. Anticipation is high coming off the back of  The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt's critical and commercial success, though.  This is not the first time a games developer has run into this type of situation.

According to postal letters sent to customers, GameStop said an undisclosed number of online customers had their credit card or bankcard data stolen, including the card numbers, expiration dates, names, addresses and the three-digit card verification values (CVV2). The breach occurred between Aug 10, 2016 to Feb 9, 2017, according to GameStop. In April, the company publicly acknowledged the breach. But, it wasn\u2019t until last week that affected customers were individually notified that their cards were likely stolen. \u201cI\u2019m pretty upset at GameStop. I should have been notified when they knew about it in April,\u201d said GameStop customer Ryan Duff, a former cyber operations tactician at U.S. Cyber Command. As a security professional, he said he expected better of GameStop when it came to notifying him of a possible breach of his credit card information. Subsequently, Duff said, the card used on GameStop.com back in November had been compromised, according to his bank. \u201cThere is no way it should have taken months to be notified,\u201d he said. Breach notification laws differ from state to state. But many states, such as Massachusetts, mandate victims be notified \u201cas soon as practicable and without unreasonable delay\u201d or the company may face civil penalties. The rules are there, in part, to allow for consumers to freeze accounts and avoid paying fees associated with having their card stolen. \u201cAfter receiving a report that data from payment card used on www.GameStop.com may have been obtained by unauthorized individuals, we immediately began an investigation and hired a leading cybersecurity firm to assist us,\u201d wrote J. Paul Raines, chief executive officer of GameStop in a letter dated June 2 that was sent sent to impacted customers. \u201cAlthough the investigation did not identify evidence of unauthorized access to payment card data, we determined on April 18, 2017 that the potential for what to have occurred existed for certain transactions,\u201d he wrote. GameStop operates 7,500 retail stores and its consumer product network online includes GameStop.com, game site Kongregate.com and online retailer ThinkGeek.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: been compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: had been compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: have been obtained, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: unauthorized access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

In April, GameStop issued the statement: \u201cGameStop recently received notification from a third party that it believed payment card data from cards used on the GameStop.com website was being offered for sale on a website.\u201d Krebs on Security reported in April that GameStop had received an alert from a credit card processor stating that its website was potentially comprised. Originally, it was believed that the breach involved GameStop retail stores and that the company\u2019s point-of-sale system may have been infected with malware. That was because the breach occurred at the height of the holiday sales season and that stolen data included card verification values (CVV2). Online merchants are not supposed to store CVV2 codes on their e-commerce sites. However, since GameStop said no retail customers were impacted, it is now believed that GameStop.com was hacked and that the data was stolen through the use of malware. Over the past 12 months, there has been an unprecedented number of data breaches. Some of those impacted have been ecommerce sites running vulnerable versions of Magento and WordPress and ecommerce platforms Powerfront CMS and OpenCart. Criminals have used a number of techniques to siphon off credit card data from these sites ranging from compromised ecommerce plugins that can perform reflected XSS (cross-site scripting) attacks, web-based keyloggers, and DOM-based XSS attacks. Over 2,000 WordPress sites are infected as part of a keylogger campaign that leverages an old malicious script.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: had been stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: siphon, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Others are drawn by the service's more recent features. Those include Snapcash, a method introduced for users to send mobile payments to their friends. Given the app's popularity, it's no wonder online criminals have set their sights on hacking users' Snapchat accounts. For instance, back in late 2013, a group of hackers published a database containing the usernames and phone numbers of approximately 4.6 million Snapchat users. Nefarious individuals could have used that information to profile targets across multiple web accounts. We also can't forget about the security incident that occurred back in February 2016. In that attack, someone posed as the company's CEO and convinced a Snapchat employee to send over payroll information. The successful phish ultimately compromised dozens of employees' identities. To be fair, a mega breach on the scale of what affected LinkedIn, Tumblr, and Yahoo has yet to strike the messaging app. But that's not to say criminals aren't trying to find a way into people's accounts. Hackers clearly have Snapchat in their sights, which is why users need to learn how to spot the warning signs of a hack and how they can recover their accounts if someone compromises them.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: published, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the security incident, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: that attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: posed as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Security researchers Victor Gevers and Niall Merrigan, who monitored the MongoDB and Elasticsearch attacks so far, have also started keeping track of the new Hadoop and CouchDB victims. The two have put together spreadsheets on Google Docs where they document the different attack signatures and messages left behind after data gets wiped from databases. In the case of Hadoop, a framework used for distributed storage and processing of large data sets, the attacks observed so far can be described as vandalism. That's because the attackers don't ask for payments to be made in exchange for returning the deleted data. Instead, their message instructs the Hadoop administrators to secure their deployments in the future. According to Merrigan's latest count, 126 Hadoop instances have been wiped so far. The number of victims is likely to increase because there are thousands of Hadoop deployments accessible from the internet -- although it's hard to say how many are vulnerable. The attacks against MongoDB and Elasticsearch followed a similar pattern. The number of MongoDB victims jumped from hundreds to thousands in a matter of hours and to tens of thousands within a week. The latest count puts the number of wiped MongoDB databases at more than 34,000 and that of deleted Elasticsearch clusters at more than 4,600. A group called Kraken0, responsible for most of the ransomware attacks against databases, is trying to sell its attack toolkit and a list of vulnerable MongoDB and Elasticsearch installations for the equivalent of US$500 in bitcoins. The number of wiped CouchDB databases is also growing rapidly, reaching more than 400 so far. CouchDB is a NoSQL-style database platform similar to MongoDB. Unlike the Hadoop vandalism, the CouchDB attacks are accompanied by ransom messages, with attackers asking for 0.1 bitcoins (around $100) to return the data. Victims are advised against paying because, in many of the MongoDB attacks, there was no evidence that attackers had actually copied the data before deleting it. Researchers from Fidelis Cybersecurity have also observed the Hadoop attacks and have published a blog post with more details and recommendations on securing such deployments[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ask for payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: asking for, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: copied, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

A translated version of the ransom note is available below. There are several things that stand out about this threat. The first is the humongous ransom demand it asks victims for, which is 545,000 Russian rubles (~$9,100). This ransom demand is between 10 and 100 times over the price of some phones, and most users who can't remove the screen locker will instead choose to buy a new phone rather than paying the crooks. To pay the ransom, victims have to enter their credit card number directly in the ransom screen, a technique very different from how other ransomware operators like to work, which is via Bitcoin, Tor, or gift cards. The other thing that sets this ransomware apart is the usage of the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) platform, now renamed in Firebase Cloud Messaging.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransom note, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom note, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: asks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Hackers managed to steal a database of Darkode's users, including usernames and hashed passwords. Paid breach notification site LeakBase provided Motherboard with a copy of the data.

The group, dubbed FIN10 by FireEye researchers, first gets access to the target companies\u2019 systems through spear-phishing (and possibly other means), then uses publicly available software, scripts and techniques to gain a foothold into victims\u2019 networks. They use Meterpreter or the SplinterRAT to establish the initial foothold within victim environments (and later a permanent backdoor), then custom PowerShell-based utilities, the pen-testing tool PowerShell Empire, and scheduled tasks to achieve persistence.  \u201cWe have also observed FIN10 using PowerShell to load Metasploit Meterpreter stagers into memory,\u201d the researchers noted. The group leverages Windows Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and single-factor protected VPN to access various systems within the environment. Finally, they  deploy destructive batch scripts intended to delete critical system files and shutdown network systems, in order to disrupt the normal operations of those systems. \u201cIn all but one targeted intrusion we have attributed to FIN10, the attacker(s) demanded a variable sum payable in Bitcoin for the non-release of sensitive data obtained during network reconnaissance stages,\u201d the researchers say. They requested sum varies between 100 to 500 Bitcoin. If the ransom isn\u2019t paid, they publish the stolen data on Pastebin-type sites. The researchers do not mention if any of the companies refused to pay and ended up having their systems and networks disrupted. For the time being, the group seems to have concentrated on hitting companies in North America, predominately in Canada. They\u2019ve also concentrated on two types of businesses: mining companies and casinos. Still, it\u2019s possible that they\u2019ve targeted companies in other industries, or will do so in the future.

The malware, called Erebus, has been responsible for hijacking 153 Linux-based networks of a South Korean web-hosting company called NAYANA. Erebus is a ransomware capable of infecting Linux operating systems. As such, around 3,400 of NAYANA\u2019s clients were affected due to the attack with databases, websites and other files being encrypted. The incident took place on 10th June. As of now, NAYANA has not received the keys to decrypt their files despite having paid three parts of the ransom. The fourth one, which is allegedly the last installment, is yet to be paid. However, according to NAYANA, the attackers claimed to provide the key after three payments. According to Trend Micro\u2019s report, Erebus was originally found back in September 2016. At the time, the malware was not that harmful and was being distributed through malware-containing advertisements. Once the user clicked on those ads, the ransomware would activate in the usual way. The initial version of the Erebus only affected 423 file types and did so using the RSA-2048 encryption algorithm, thereby encrypting the files with the .encrypt extension. Furthermore, it was this variant that was using a number of websites in South Korea as a command-&-control (C&C) center. Later, in February 2017, the malware had seemingly evolved as now it had the ability to bypass User Account Control (UAC). For those who may be unfamiliar with UAC, it is primarily a Windows privacy protection system that restricts anyone who is not authorized, to alter the user\u2019s computer. However, this later version of the Erebus was able to do so and inject ransomware ever so conveniently. The campaign in which this version was involved demanded a ransom of 0.085 bitcoins \u2013 equivalent to USD 216 at present \u2013 and threatened to delete the files in 96 hours if the ransom was not paid. Now, however, Erebus has reached new heights by having the ability to bypass not only UAC but also affect entire networks that run on Linux. Given that most organizations today use Linux for their networks, it is no surprise to see that the effects of the malware are far-reaching.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanded a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Also, the attack is accompanied by a Bluetooth service so as to ensure that the ransomware does not break, even after the computer is rebooted. This version can affect a total of 433 file types including databases, archives, office documents, email files, web-based files and multimedia files. The ransom demanded in this campaign amounts to 5 bitcoins, which is USD 12,344 currently. Although ransomware affecting Linux based networks are rare, they are, however, not new. Erebus is not the first ransomware to have affected networks running on Linux. In fact, Trend Micro claims that such ransomware was discovered as far back as in 2014. Some of the ransomware include Linux.Encoder, Encrypter RaaS, KillDisk, KimcilWare and much more. All of these were allegedly developed from an open-source code project that was available as part of an educational campaign. The ransomware for Linux, despite being somewhat inferior to those for Windows, are still potent enough to cause damage on a massive scale. This is because, a number of organizations and data centers use Linux, and hijacking such high-end systems can only mean catastrophe. To avoid any accidents happening, IT officials and organizations running Linux-based networks need to take some serious precautions.\u00a0The most obvious one is to simply keep the server updated with the latest firmware and anti-virus software. Furthermore, it is always a good idea to keep a back-up of your data files in two to three separate locations.\u00a0It is also repeatedly advised to avoid installing unknown third-party programs as these can act as potential gateways for such ransomware. Lastly, IT administrators should keep monitoring the traffic that passes through the network and looks for anomalies by identifying any inconsistencies in event logs.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransom demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The university describes it as a \"ransomware\" attack, such as last month's cyber-attack which threatened NHS computer systems. The attack was continuing on Thursday, with access to online networks being restricted. The university has warned staff and students of the risk of data loss and \"very substantial disruption\". University College London (UCL) is a \"centre of excellence in cyber-security research\", a status awarded by the GCHQ intelligence and monitoring service. The central London university, ranked last week in the world's top 10, says that a \"widespread ransomware attack\" began on Wednesday. It was first blamed on so-called \"phishing\" emails, with links to destructive software.  But later the university suggested it was more likely to be from contact with a \"compromised\" website, where clicking on a pop-up page might have spread a malware infection. Ransomware attacks are where computer systems are locked and threatened with damaging software unless payments are made. Students and staff were warned that \"ransomware damages files on your computer and on shared drives where you save files\" and were told not to open any suspicious attachments. The university says that it believes the risk of further infection has been contained, but it is urging staff and students to help with efforts to reduce any \"further spread of this malware\". Universities, which often carry out commercially sensitive research, have become frequent targets for cyber-attacks. \"However, what makes this attack interesting is the timing,\" said Graham Rymer, an ethical hacker and research associate at the University of Cambridge. \"Hackers tend to target people who will be desperate to get access to their data and are, therefore, more likely to pay the ransom. \"Currently there are a lot of students who will be putting the final touches to their dissertations, so it could be that they were the targets.\" Mr Rymer said UCL seemed to have responded well to the attack and had \"locked it down pretty well\". \"One thing UCL did is to quickly switch all drives in the system to \"read-only\" following the attack, which essentially prevented the malware from doing real damage.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: \"ransomware\" attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: Ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: get access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The attack appears to have struck Northern Ireland\u2019s Ulster University on the same day a ransomware outage affected University College London (UCL). Ulster Uni\u2019s Information Services Division (ISD) revealed yesterday that its AV partner suspects a zero-day threat was the cause, also echoing the current thinking at UCL. Three departmental file shares have been affected and remained at \u201cread only\u201d access at the time of writing. Like its counterparts at UCL, Ulster University\u2019s ISD appears to be following best practice regarding back-ups, which will help mitigate the impact of the attack. It explained: \u201cISD take backups of all our shared drives and this should protect most data even if it has been encrypted by the malware. Once we are confident the infections have been contained, then we will restore the most recent back up of the file. ISD can confirm that a backup of the shares was successfully taken at close of business on Tuesday 12th June.\u201d Fraser Kyne, EMEA CTO at Bromium, urged all UK university IT teams to be on high alert for possible attacks. \u201cThe initial reports are suggesting that the ransomware was able to get in at UCL through a zero-day exploit, which allowed it to bypass antivirus software,\u201d he added. \u201cThat really underscores the limitations of antivirus; in that it is only able to stop things that it knows are bad. Given that most malware is only seen once in the wild before it evolves into something different, there\u2019s very little that antivirus can offer in the way of protection.\u201d UCL now believes the initial infection vector was a user visiting a compromised website rather than opening a phishing email attachment as first thought. The latest stats from Malwarebytes show the UK is the hardest hit in Europe when it comes to ransomware. There were three-times as many detections in the UK in Q1 2017 than the next most impacted country: France. In fact, while ransomware infections dropped 4% across Europe they increased 57% in the UK year-on-year.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has been hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware outage, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The goal of the campaign is to gain control of the target businesses\u2019 systems, install a backdoor, and through it perform continual exfiltration of financial information. \u201cLike past attacks, the initial infection vector is a malicious Word document attached to a phishing email that is well-tailored to the targeted business and its day-to-day operations,\u201d the researchers noted.  \u201cThe Word document executes a fileless attack that uses DNS queries to deliver the next shellcode stage (Meterpreter). However, in this new variant, all the DNS activity is initiated and executed solely from memory \u2013 unlike previous attacks which used PowerShell commands.\u201d The researchers attribute this one important change to the group\u2019s efforts to stay one step ahead of the defenders, and they are succeeding:  \u201cAfter decryption of the second stage shellcode, the shellcode deletes the \u2018MZ\u2019 prefix from within a very important part of the shellcode. This prefix indicates it may be a DLL, and its deletion helps the attack to evade memory scanning solutions,\u201d the researchers found. \u201cIf this DLL was saved on disk, many security solutions would immediately identify it as a CobaltStrike Meterpreter, which is used by many attackers and pen testers.\u201d But it\u2019s not, and it passes undetected. In-memory resident attacks and the use of fileless malware are on the rise, and FIN7 is one group that has been employing this approach regularly.  There can be no doubt other attackers will try to implement the same tactic. FIN7 has previously been tied to a sophisticated spear-phishing campaign hitting US-based businesses with emails purportedly coming from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and Morphisec researchers believe that the series of attacks leveraged against 140+ banks and other businesses earlier this year is also their work.

The ISP in question, KWIC Internet in Simcoe, Ontario, fixed the Rsync problems after being notified by Salted Hash, but it isn\u2019t clear how long the company\u2019s customers were exposed. Via email, Vickery shared his latest findings with Salted Hash last week. [ Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need. Initially, Vickery discovered databases belonging to Annex Business Media, a publishing firm with offices in Simcoe and Aurora, Ontario. One of the exposed Annex databases stood out to him, as it contained the data from the 2015 Ashley Madison data breach. The other databases contained customer information (names, email addresses, etc.) Salted Hash reached out to Annex Business Media and asked about the Ashley Madison records, as well as to inform them about the more recent security problems, but the company didn\u2019t respond to questions. Additional digging led Vickery to discover that Annex was just one part of a larger data breach, one that affected all of KWIC Internet's customers. \u201cI quickly realized that this one is going to be a real mess for someone to clean up and quite a headache to determine all the affected parties,\u201d Vickery told Salted Hash. In all, there were terabytes of KWIC data exposed by the breach. The information inside the leaked databases included credit card details, email addresses, passwords, names, home and business addresses, phone numbers, email backups, VPN details and credentials, internal KWIC backups, and more. The KWIC archives also included a common PHP shell named r57, and a PHP-based DDoS tool, suggesting that the company had been hacked at some point prior to leaking their backups to the public. \u201cThere are dozens of SQL database backup files and thousands of email backup directories containing everything from internal KWIC staff login credentials to police warrants for ISP subscriber information,\u201d Vickery said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being notified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: his latest findings, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: a larger data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed by the breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: had been hacked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Criminals often try to bypass existing security solutions on the device in question, but they also distribute fake tools that allegedly prevent these attacks from happening. This trend is called \u201crogue security software,\u201d and has been proven to be quite successful over the past few years. This rogue anti-spyware program is a clone\u00a0of \u00a0the Total Virus Protection malware whose origin points to the Russian Federation. The software offers you an option to purchase a license in order to remove those programs when in fact the \u201cinfections\u201d are critical system files. Many more clones of this software exist, and 2017 variants have been spotted in the wild already. ANG Antivirus only targets Microsoft Windows users, the good news is that it is not too harmful because it\u2019s main goal is to scare you into buying a software license. However, some variants have proven to be more harmful and may even steal sensitive user information. Do not confuse this \u201ctool\u201d with the official Microsoft Security Essentials software, as they are nothing alike. Security Essentials 2010 is a malware strain first discovered in February of 2010. Its most powerful threat is how the malware prevents users from launching over 150 different programs, including most browsers and the Windows Command Prompt. Unlike ANG Antivirus, Security Essentials uses 3rd party trojans that disguise themselves as flash updates that are\u00a0required to view online videos. Once baited, the trojan will install a number of malware including Security Essentials 2010. Similar to the previous scareware, this one will also prompt you to purchase a license to supposedly remove quite a few threats, all of which are obviously fake. Thankfully, this malware has not been reported of stealing personal information or any more sensitive info and is no longer an active threat. The funny part about this program is that it started as a legitimate anti-spam system that\u00a0tried to automate the complaint process for email spam. The program would allow for a user to send a complaint about a spam email to the software.

Macintosh users are also in need of proper security tools to keep their computer safe from harm. Mac Defender tried to fill this need, even though its developers had less honorable intentions.

Instead, the Zinaps software wants to perform fake computer scans and trick users into buying a license.

This past fall, an investment firm rattled the health care industry with unsubstantiated claims of multiple software vulnerabilities in internet-connected pacemakers and cardiac defibrillators. But it took federal authorities who regulate medical devices four months to acknowledge only one of the alleged defects, and for the company, St. Jude Medical, to patch it. The delayed response to a problem that could potentially put patients at risk raises many questions about why it took so long for the government to act, and what it will take for the health care industry to respond more swiftly to bugs in medical equipment increasingly connected to the internet. \"Software is never perfect and all systems still will have these flaws,\" says Joshua Corman, director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council and an expert on medical device security. \"The question is how gracefully and collaboratively and quickly and safely can we respond to these flaws.\" In this particular case,\u00a0legal action\u00a0as well as the unusual way the St. Jude vulnerabilities came to light\u00a0may have stifled the response. A cybersecurity firm called MedSec initially discovered the problems in the St. Jude devices and tipped off the activist investment firm\u00a0Muddy Waters, which publicized the flaws and advised clients to\u00a0bet against the health care firm's stock. As a result, St. Jude lodged a defamation lawsuit against MedSec and Muddy Waters, denying many of the alleged glitches in its pacemaker and implantable defibrillator systems. \"In theory, most disclosures now should take about 60 days to get to some clarity or resolution,\" said Corman. \"In part, because of the contentious nature and the lawyers involved in this particular one, it took about five months.\" Last week, the Food and Drug Administration along with the Department of Homeland Security confirmed at least some of MedSec's findings and\u00a0reported a flaw\u00a0in\u00a0the St. Jude @Merlin transmitter, an at-home computer that sends data from cardiac implants to the patient's medical team. The flaw could have allowed malicious\u00a0hackers to remotely exhaust an implant's battery power or potentially harm the patient.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: reveals, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: unsubstantiated claims, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: acknowledge, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: initially discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: publicized, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: confirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: MedSec's findings and\u00a0reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Carson Block, the firm's founder, said this week the root causes of the vulnerabilities demand a change to firmware inside the St. Jude implants\u00a0themselves. The firm said in a statement, \"these issues have just been given a quick fix by St. Jude with the government's blessing and cardiologists should go with other pacemaker manufacturers since they are much better on cybersecurity.\" It's important to note that all the players in this medical legal drama, as well as the\u00a0Veterans Affairs Department, which buys St. Jude devices,\u00a0say there have been no reports of patient harm related to the cybersecurity vulnerabilities reported late August. In fact, the VA in recent months has continued paying for operations involving St. Jude \u00a0devices, according to contract documents. Ever since the US government and St. Jude confirmed the one flaw, the VA has been \"taking steps to be sure all our patients and providers are aware of this issue and take appropriate actions to be sure that all our patients get the update for their monitor,\u201d said Merritt Raitt, acting director of the VA National Cardiac Device Surveillance Program. The controversy could have been partly avoided, perhaps, if St. Jude and MedSec had followed new federal regulations for medical\u00a0device security that encourage manufacturers to be more proactive about addressing potential\u00a0vulnerabilities. A week before federal regulators publicized the one St. Jude glitch on Jan. 9, they announced the completion of a 2016 draft policy that might have yielded multiple fixes\u00a0in two months\u00a0without anyone resorting to public shaming or legal action. On Jan. 4, DHS circulated the final\u00a0Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cybersecurity guidelines\u00a0for monitoring networked medical devices on the market that threaten manufacturers with penalties such as a recall unless they cooperate with bug hunters to patch vulnerabilities\u00a0within 60 days.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: claims, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the claims, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have just been given, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: confirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Today\u2019s connected cars are miles ahead technologically speaking of those \u201cdumb\u201d vehicles, but drivers could see a bumpy ride if thieves get a hold of the data the car possesses. The Internet of Things (IoT) has created an entirely new market in the automotive industry with connected car services that are driving new recurring revenue growth and transforming the industry. And that trajectory is expected to continue, growing from $13.6 to top $42 billion by 2022. Vehicles contain critical personal information such as personal contacts, registration and insurance details, financial information and even the address to the owner's home \u2013 making entry, theft and further damage even more of a possibility. Vehicles have become an extension of one\u2019s connected self and the technology associated with them offers substantial benefits. With the emergence of sophisticated technology, the nature of vehicle theft has changed. A major adversary of today\u2019s vehicle owner is a smarter, connected and more targeted network of criminals, known as \u2018Connected Vehicle Thieves\u2019. LoJack, provider of vehicle theft recovery and advanced fleet management solutions, shows how these New Age thieves can take advantage of the technology in vehicles. Vehicle-enabled ransom: One growing and increasingly lucrative type of cybercrime is\u00a0the use of ransomware, where inserted malware encrypts digital data and instructs a victim to pay the criminal a ransom to restore the decrypted information. With the emergence of the connected car and vehicles being used as WiFi hot spots, vehicle-enabled ransomware is a predictable next step for hackers, exploiting this new avenue to commit digital \u201ckidnapping\u201d. For example, in the near future, they could easily break into a vehicle, disable the engine and brakes, and demand bitcoin to restore the car to its functional state. Scanner boxes as smart keys: Thieves have begun carrying scanner boxes, or devices that can exploit the electronic system utilized by key fobs. These criminals can then unlock, and even start, a vehicle without even touching the key. Once the key comes in close enough range to the scanner box and is compromised. Data leading to identity theft: These days, connected cars carry more information and personal data than ever before, making identity theft a more serious threat.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Vehicle-enabled ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: digital \u201ckidnapping\u201d, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demand bitcoin, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

When successfully installed, Disttrack can corrupt files and overwrite a system\u2019s master boot record, rendering the device unusable. \u201cThreats with such destructive payloads are unusual and are not typical of targeted attacks,\u201d security researchers wrote in a blog post shortly after the originally Saudi energy breach. On Monday, Symantec published what it believes are ties between Shamoon and another cyber espionage group, named Greenbug. Greenbug relies on a unique, custom information-stealing remote access trojan, or RAT, known as Trojan.Ismdoor, in addition to a suite of commoditized credentials stealing hacking tools. Greenbug tends to use phishing emails to infect victims. The group typically targets Middle Eastern aviation, government, investment and education organizations, Symantec\u2019s research team said. Between June and November 2016, Trojan.Ismdoor was used against multiple organizations based in the Middle East. \u201cThe use and purpose [of Trojan.Ismdoor] do fit that of malware used by nation state attackers. Additionally, the information gathering conducted once the attacker is on the network also supports the types of operations seen by nation state attackers,\u201d Symantec senior threat intelligence analyst\u00a0Jon DiMaggio told CyberScoop. Researchers say there is at least one case in which the two hacking groups \u2014 Shamoon and Greenbug \u2014 may have been simultaneously active inside a victim\u2019s computer network. In this context, it is possible that Greenbug \u2014 acting as the espionage arm for Shamoon \u2014 collects the necessary information needed to conduct the disk-wiping attack.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: corrupt, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: custom information-stealing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: use, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: collects, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

On the third day, on Friday, January 13, Bleeping Computer received two separate tips, via email and Twitter, from two hackers that appeared to know each other. Hacker #1 sent Bleeping Computer a link to a PasteBin page that contained a copy of an email the group allegedly sent to a high-ranking Lloyds Bank manager. The email, pictured below, contained a ransom demand disguised as a \"consultancy fee\" the group was asking to reveal \"security issues\" that affected Lloyd Bank's online banking portals.

The group of experts, led by Associate Professor Zeynep Tufekci have written an open letter demanding that the article is retracted and for The Guardian to issue an apology for the misleading claims. The article, written by freelance journalist Manisha Ganguly reported claims originally made by a UC Berkeley PhD student Tobias Boelter last year. He showed that under certain conditions a government could, with the cooperation of WhatsApp, gain access to the content of a small number of messages. The consensus of 40 of the most respected people from the security and cryptographic community however was that the behaviour described by PhD student Tobias Boelter, and sensationalised in The Guardian article, was simply a design decision taken by WhatsApp developers and represented a very small risk, if any, to the vast majority of users. The Guardian has so far refused the demands of Professor Tufekci and her colleagues and simply updated the article changing the word \u201cbackdoor\u201d for \u201cvulnerability\u201d and including a statement from WhatsApp stating categorically that \u201cWhatsApp does not give governments a \u2018backdoor\u2019 into its systems and would fight any government request to create a backdoor\u201d. Tufekci made the point that The Guardian\u2019s article had endangered people because they would switch to less secure forms of communication over concerns that governments could be potentially listening into conversations. The suggestion that people should use the potentially more secure app Signal was not going to work for most people because it was less user-friendly and simply by using an app like Signal could actually alert government agencies that they had something to hide. The Guardian article took the claims of a PhD student and failed to get input into the issue from a single recognised security or cryptography expert. The opinions quoted in the article came from three people who, although involved with privacy at the policy and user level, were by no means subject matter experts and couldn\u2019t possibly have claimed to understand what had been implemented. In fact, Moxie Marlinspike, the developer behind Signal, the protocol that gives WhatsApp its end-to-end encryption also came out emphatically supporting WhatsApp\u2019s implementation of the Signal Protocol.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: publishing a story claiming, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported claims, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: showed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

According to the survey, 55 percent of companies said they thought it was either likely or certain that the ransomware also exfiltrated data from the infected device. Businesses should not only have anti-virus in place to keep ransomware from getting in, but also train their employees to spot potential attacks.

A report published by threat intelligence firm CrowdStrike before Christmas revealed that the Russia-linked cyberespionage group known as Fancy Bear (aka APT28, Pawn Storm, Sofacy, Tsar Team, Strontium and Sednit) modified a legitimate Android app used by the Ukrainian military. Specifically, researchers found an Android version of X-Agent, a piece of malware known to be used by Fancy Bear, embedded in an app developed by artillery officer Yaroslav Sherstuk to help military personnel reduce the time to fire D-30 howitzers. According to CrowdStrike, the malicious app, which had been distributed on Ukrainian military forums from late 2014 through 2016, was capable of accessing contact information, SMS messages, call logs and Internet data. The security firm believes these capabilities could have allowed Russia to track Ukrainian troops via the app. CrowdStrike also pointed to a report claiming that Ukraine had lost many D-30 guns in the past years, and speculated that this cyber operation may have contributed to those losses. Based on its investigation, the company is confident that Fancy Bear is connected to the Russian military, particularly the GRU foreign military intelligence agency. Sherstuk has called CrowdStrike\u2019s report \u201cdelusional\u201d and pointed out that the app is not open source. He says the application has been under his control and he personally oversees the activation of each installation. Jeffrey Carr, CEO of Taia Global and founder of the Suits and Spooks conference, has analyzed CrowdStrike\u2019s report and, after contacting several other experts, he determined that the security firm\u2019s arguments are flawed. According to Carr, while X-Agent may be used by Fancy Bear, the malware is not exclusive to the group. The X-Agent source code appears to have been obtained by several entities, including Ukrainian hacktivist Sean Townsend and the security firm ESET. The X-Agent variant found in the Ukraine military app has also been analyzed by Crysys, the Hungary-based security firm that has investigated several sophisticated pieces of malware, including Duqu.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: accessing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Pavlo Narozhnyy, a technical adviser to Ukraine\u2019s military, told VOA that he doubts the D-30 app can be hacked, and he claimed that none of the app\u2019s users reported any D-30 howitzer losses.

Charger was found embedded in an app called EnergyRescue. The infected app steals contacts and SMS messages from the user\u2019s device and asks for admin permissions. If granted, the ransomware locks the device and displays a message demanding payment. Researchers detected and quarantined the Android device of an unsuspecting customer employee who had unknowingly downloaded and installed Charger. The early detection enabled them to quickly disclose the findings to Android\u2019s Security team that added the malware to Android\u2019s built-in protection mechanisms before it began to spread, ensuring only a handful of devices were infected. Unlike most malware found on Google Play, that contains a dropper that later downloads the real malicious components to the device, Charger uses a heavy packing approach. This makes it harder for the malware to stay hidden. Charger\u2019s developers compensated for this using a variety of techniques to boost its evasion capabilities so it could stay hidden on Google Play for as long as possible. These included: The ransom demand is for 0.2 Bitcoins or roughly $180 and is much higher than what has been seen in previous mobile ransomware attacks. By comparison, the DataLust ransomware demanded merely $15 and could be an indicator of a wider effort by mobile malware developers to catch up with their PC ransomware cousins. Similar to other malware seen in the past, Charger checks the local settings of the device and does not run its malicious logic if the device is located in Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus. This is likely done to keep the developers from being prosecuted in their own countries or being extradited between countries[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steals, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: displays, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

There\u2019s an app for just about any facet of one\u2019s personal and professional life, from booking travel and managing projects, to buying groceries and binge-watching the latest Netflix series. The iOS and Android apps for Netflix\u00a0are enormously popular, effectively turning a mobile device into a television with which users can stream full movies and TV programs anytime, anywhere. But the apps, with their many millions of users, have captured the attention of the bad actors, too, who are exploiting the popularity of Netflix to spread malware. Recently, the ThreatLabZ research team came across a fake Netflix app, which turned out to be a new variant of SpyNote RAT (Remote Access Trojan). Please note that our research is not about the legitimate\u00a0Netflix app on Google Play. The spyware in this analysis was portraying itself as the Netflix app. Once installed, it displayed the icon found in the actual Netflix app on Google Play. This is a common trick played by malware developers, making the user think the app may have been removed. But, behind the scenes, the malware has not been removed; instead it starts preparing its onslaught of attacks. It does so using the Services, Broadcast Receivers,\u00a0and\u00a0Activities components of the Android platform. Services\u00a0can perform long-running operations in the background and does not need a user interface. Broadcast Receivers\u00a0are Android components that can register themselves for particular events. Activities are key building blocks, central to an app\u2019s navigation, for example. The SpyNote RAT registers a service called AutoStartup\u00a0and a broadcast receiver named\u00a0BootComplete. MainActivity\u00a0registers\u00a0BootComplete\u00a0with a boot event, so that whenever the device is booted,\u00a0BootComplete\u00a0gets triggered. BootComplete\u00a0starts the\u00a0AutoStartup\u00a0service and the\u00a0AutoStartup\u00a0service makes sure that\u00a0MainActivity\u00a0is always running. What follows are some of the features exhibited by SpyNote RAT. Command execution can create havoc for victim if the malware developer decides to execute commands in the victim\u2019s device. Leveraging this feature, the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities, well-known or zero-day. SpyNote RAT was able to take screen captures and, using the device\u2019s microphone, listen to audio conversations.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: was portraying itself as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: displayed, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: a common trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Crowdstrike\u2019s core argument has three premises: If all of these premises were true, then Crowdstrike\u2019s prior claim that Fancy Bear must be affiliated with the GRU [4] would be substantially supported by this new finding. Dmitri referred to it in the PBS interview as \u201cDNA evidence\u201d. In fact, none of those premises are supported by the facts. This article is a summary of the evidence that I\u2019ve gathered during hours of interviews and background research with Ukrainian hackers, soldiers, and an independent analysis of the malware by CrySys Lab. My complete findings will be presented in Washington D.C. next week on January 12th at\u00a0Suits and Spooks. Crowdstrike, along with FireEye and other cybersecurity companies, have long propagated the claim that Fancy Bear and all of its affiliated monikers (APT28, Sednit, Sofacy, Strontium, Tsar Team, Pawn Storm, etc.) were the exclusive developers and users of X-Agent. If both a security company and a hacker collective have the X-Agent source code, then so do others, and attribution to APT28/Fancy Bear/GRU based solely upon the presumption of \u201cexclusive use\u201d must be thrown out. This doesn\u2019t mean that the Russian government may not choose to use it. In fact, Sean Townsend believes that the Russian security services DO use it but he also knows that they aren\u2019t the only ones. The first iteration of the POPR-D30 Android app designed by Ukrainian military officer Jaroslav Sherstuk (and the only iteration allegedly impacted by this malware) was a simple ballistics program that calculated corrections for humidity, atmospheric pressure, and other environmental factors that determine accuracy of the D-30 Howitzer. The Android APK malware doesn\u2019t use GPS nor does it ask for GPS location information from the infected phone or tablet. That\u2019s a surprising design flaw for custom-made malware whose alleged objective was to collect and transmit location data on Ukrainian artillery to the GRU.

Crowdstrike\u2019s estimate of 80% losses of the D-30 Howitzers came from one source\u200a\u2014\u200aan article written by pro-Russian blogger Boris Rozhin, a resident of Crimea who writes for a blog called The Saker which he calls \u201cthe voice of totalitarian propaganda\u201d Bloomberg journalist\u00a0Leonid Bershidsky\u00a0pointed out that the estimates \u201cappear to be based on an assumption that changes in military balance reports, themselves far from perfect, can be interpreted as losses. Ukraine, a nation at war, doesn\u2019t broadcast information about its specific capabilities\u201d. Pavlo Narozhnyy, a Ukraine military advisor, told\u00a0VOA\u00a0that \u201cI personally know hundreds of gunmen in the war zone. None of them told me of D-30 losses caused by hacking or any other reason\u201d. Even\u00a0Rozhin\u00a0acknowledged that his interpretation of the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) data needs work: \u201cGenerally speaking, both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, as it is obvious that lost armour did not count everything destroyed, as well as that the loss of hardware (counted based on staffing standards) in some cases did not mean that it was destroyed. For example, some hardware lost after 2013 was left in Crimea and returned to Ukraine only partially. Some hardware could have existed only on paper and even before the war could have been non-repairable. This suggests that the real losses of the UA still need to be further researched to make the conclusions more precise\u201d. While the original POPR-D30 app was available for download online, users had to contact Sherstuk personally and provide their military credentials in order to receive a code for activation. There is no evidence that any of those users had their apps compromised by malware. In fact, Crowdstrike hasn\u2019t provided any evidence that the malware-infected Android app was used by even a single Ukrainian soldier.

The GRU, according to Crowdstrike, developed a variant of X-Agent to infect an Android mobile app in order to geolocate and destroy Ukraine\u2019s D-30 howitzers. To do this, they chose an artillery app which had no way to send or receive data, and wrote malware for it that didn\u2019t ask for GPS position information? Crowdstrike never contacted the app\u2019s developer to inform him about their findings. Had they performed that simple courtesy, they might have learned from Jaroslav Sherstuk how improbable, if not impossible, their theory was. Instead, they worked inside of their own research bubble, performed no verification of infected applications or tablets used by Ukraine\u2019s artillery corps, and extrapolated an effect of 80% losses based upon a self-proclaimed, pro-Russian propagandist and an imaginary number of infected applications.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: has been obtained, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Now someone is apparently taking matters into their owns hands, helpfully alerting admins that their databases are vulnerable to attack. \"It looks like a friendly warning,\" Victor Gevers, chairman of the non-profit GDI Foundation which discloses security issues to affected victims, told Motherboard in a Twitter message. Gevers has been tracking the malicious attacks since they began in December, and on Monday started following this rather strange twist. But the vigilante, whoever they may be, is creating an empty folder called \"your_db_is_not_secure\" in some open databases. So far, the message has been placed into 49 of the 2,641 open databases using the Cassandra software, Gevers told Motherboard. It's not clear how effective this approach will actually be at informing potential victims, however, considering that database administrators might not even notice the slight change. Gevers recently wrote in a tweet that the GDI Foundation has been informing victims too via email, and another group of security experts tried sending emails en masse automatically to potential targets.

Library management refused to pay the $35,000 demanded as ransom, and IT staff wiped affected servers and restored them from available backups. On Friday, the library was able to restart its circulation workflow, and patrons were able to check out books at all locations. By Saturday, checkout and returns systems were at 100 percent availability, and now only the library\u2019s reserve system remains to be restored. That work began on Monday and is expected to be up and running shortly. Executive director Waller McGuire said the library immediately reached out to the FBI for help with the investigation, and it\u2019s not clear where the infection began, nor how it spread throughout the library network. \u201cThe real victims of this criminal attack are the Library\u2019s patrons. SLPL has worked hard to open a secure but widely available digital world to the people of St. Louis, and I am sorry it was interrupted,\u201d McGuire said in a letter to library patrons published on Monday. \u201cAn attempt to hold information and access to the world for ransom is deeply frightening and offensive to any public library, and we will make every effort to keep that world available to our patrons\u201d. McGuire also said that patrons\u2019 personal and financial information is not stored on its servers, and none of that data was impacted by the attack. Louis Public Library has been working with the FBI to identify how criminals broke into our system and correct the problem,\u201d McGuire said. \u201cI apologize to patrons for any inconvenience this incident has caused: on most days thousands of St. Louis Public Library patrons check out materials and use computers for many purposes\u201d. A request for additional comment from McGuire was not returned in time for publication. It\u2019s unknown which ransomware family was used to attack the library, nor how the infection started. McGuire said in his letter to patrons that criminals broke into the library network and installed malware. This runs contrary to most ransomware infections where the malware is spread in spam or phishing emails enticing the victim to open a malicious email attachment or click on a link in the message that downloads the malware.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: refused to pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanded as ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Lloyds revealed little at the time, despite a flood of Twitter complaints. But it has emerged that the National Cyber Security Centre is working with the bank on the attack. Despite speculation that a number of banks may have been targeted, it appears that the internet gang concentrated its fire on Lloyds. In the past, denial of service attacks have been perpetrated by customers with a grudge or by blackmailers, but there is no indication from Lloyds that a ransom demand was received. At the time, the bank was adamant that the \"vast majority\" of users were able to gain access to their accounts and move money around as normal. It's likely that systems engineers blocked all internet traffic from overseas locations where the attacks seemed to be coming from, halting the disruption at least temporarily before the attackers switched their activity elsewhere. In contrast to the hacking of Tesco Bank in November, in which \u00a32.5m was taken, there is no indication that criminals got their hands on cash in Lloyds bank accounts. However, the new National Cyber Security Centre, part of GCHQ and the UK's authority on cyber-security, is understood to be working with Lloyds on security after the attack. Lloyds Banking Group issued the following statement: \"We experienced intermittent service issues with internet banking between Wednesday morning and Friday afternoon the week before last and are sorry for any inconvenience caused. \"We had a normal service in place for the vast majority of this period and only a small number of customers experienced problems.

Earlier this week, the hacker, known only as Cipher0007, disclosed the existence of two \"high-risk\" bugs through Reddit. In a forum post, the hacker said the two security flaws could be exploited to snatch private messages. Cipher0007 was able to compromise AlphaBay and steal the first and last names of buyers and sellers, nicknames, addresses, and the tracking IDs of packages sent by traders when included in the messages and not protected by PGP keys. The hacker also issued a number of screenshots of private messages as proof, which revealed the messages were not encrypted by default. After disclosing the vulnerabilities on Reddit, Cipher0007 opened a number of support tickets on AlphaBay, warning the Dark Web trading post of the potentially devastating bugs which could compromise the privacy and identities of users. In a statement on PasteBin, AlphaBay confirmed the validity of the vulnerabilities and said the bugs allowed the hacker to slurp a total of 218,000 messages which were not older than 30 days. Older messages are automatically purged from the system. The attacker was paid for disclosing the flaws rather than selling them on or releasing the stolen information to the public. In return, Cipher0007 revealed his methods and several hours later AlphaBay developers were able to close the loopholes. As Dark Web marketplaces must provide strong assurances that users will remain anonymous due to the nature of goods sold there, often illegally, these kinds of vulnerabilities have the potential to destroy such businesses. Alternatively, these security flaws would be of interest to law enforcement agencies attempting to close down such operations -- and may have been known to them before the hacker discovered the bugs.

By Chris Duckett Google's Project Zero has found that it was previously trivial to create an SSL certificate collision thanks to Kaspersky using only the first 32 bits of an MD5 hash in its SSL proxy packaged with its Anti-Virus product. \"You don't have to be a cryptographer to understand a 32-bit key is not enough to prevent brute-forcing a collision in seconds,\" Tavis Ormandy of Project Zero said in its issue tracker. \"They effectively proxy SSL connections, inserting their own certificate as a trusted authority in the system store and then replace all leaf certificates on the fly. This is why if you examine a certificate when using Kaspersky Anti-Virus, the issuer appears to be 'Kaspersky Anti-Virus Personal Root',\" he said. \"It seems incredible that Kaspersky haven't noticed that they sometimes get certificate errors for mismatching commonNames just by random chance. After Ormandy reported the bug and received acknowledgement from Kaspersky on November 1, despite learning the security vendor was doing some commonName checks, the bug was still able to be exploited. \"If you're not being attacked, you would see random errors. A MITM [man in the middle] can send you packets from where you were expecting,\" Ormandy said on Twitter. Ormandy also found another bug on November 12 that allowed any unprivileged user to become a local certificate authority. In May last year, the Project Zero security researcher discovered that Symantec Antivirus Engine was vulnerable to buffer overflow when parsing malformed portable-executable header files that resulted in instant blue-screening and kernel memory corruption without user action on Windows. \"This is about as bad as it can possibly get,\" Ormandy said at the time.

WebEx is a popular collaboration tool for online events such as meetings, webinars and videoconferences. Like many services of this sort, you access online events via your browser, augmented by a special-purpose browser extension. Browser extensions and plugins allow web developers to extend the software features inside your browser with a mixture of scripts and program code, for example to add configuration options or to support new audio and video formats. Of course, when you add  another layer of programmatic complexity on top of an already-complex browser, it\u2019s easy to add new security holes, too. Perhaps the best known example of a problematic plugin is Adobe Flash, which has provided cybercrooks with such a fruitful source of exploitable security holes over the years that we have long been urging you to try to live without Flash altogether. The latest security scare of this sort has been dubbed CVE-2017-3823, and it applies to Cisco\u2019s special-purpose WebEx browser extension. In oher words, if your organisation uses WebEx, you probably have the browser extension installed, and if you have it installed, you may be at risk. According to Tavis Ormandy at Google\u2019s Project Zero, who discovered and documented the bug, there are more than 20 million WebEx users worldwide. According to Cisco, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Firefox on Windows are affected. Microsoft Edge on Windows and all browsers on Mac and Linux are safe. The most recent update for Chrome is Cisco WebEx extension 1.0.7. Cisco published a notification about this update at 2017-01-26T19:45Z, having issued and then withdrawn 1.0.3 and then 1.0.5 earlier this week after deeming them \u201cincomplete\u201d. However, at 2017-01-26T19:45Z, Cisco\u2019s official Security Advisory page says: Cisco is currently developing updates that address this vulnerability for Firefox and Internet Explorer.

But the doomsday scenario never materialized and you don\u2019t even seem to hear much about it anymore. In this blog post, part 1 of 2, I will explore this idea and try to understand why the CSRF giant never awoke. First we\u2019ll cover the overall threat landscape, trends, and some notable CSRF exploits throughout the years, including one from personal experience. As a quick review, CSRF exists because web applications trust the cookies sent by web browsers within an HTTP request. In a CSRF attack, the attacker causes a victim\u2019s browser to make a request that results in a change or action which benefits the attacker (and/or harms the victim) in some way. Without a specific defense \u2013 like a random token in the request body that is validated on the server side \u2013 CSRF attacks are possible. After a bit of testing, my suspicions were confirmed. All requests that caused any sort of change could be exploited with CSRF. This included: I contacted the company to let them know about these security holes. Surprisingly, they didn\u2019t seem to be aware there was such a thing as CSRF, but they thanked me anyway and rolled out a fix about a month later. There have been other notable instances of CSRF vulnerabilities with some of them being exploited in the wild. Drive-by pharming is an attack on the DNS settings of home routers and modems and often leverages CSRF as a key element. The web UIs on these devices are the culprit, because they allow users to edit configuration settings. In one attack from 2008, banking customers in Mexico who owned 2Wire DSL modems were targeted. Victims received an email with an embedded image tag with a CSRF attack that changed the DNS settings on their modem. In another instance, tens of thousands of Twitter users fell victim to a CSRF worm in 2010 when developers failed to implement anti-CSRF measures for tweets. The vulnerability was discovered and exploited in a rather distasteful but harmless way.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: let them know, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: rolled out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Anyone who clicked on the link in the first tweet also posted the same two tweets. The worm spread like wildfire before it was fixed by Twitter. In 2012 Facebook\u2019s App Center was vulnerable to CSRF and the security researcher who discovered the flaw was awarded $5000 as a bounty. Interestingly, in this case the HTTP request included an anti-CSRF token that appeared at first glance to provide protection, but the token was not being validated by the server-side application when the request was received. A Qualys researcher found other examples where anti-CSRF tokens were not properly validated. And similar to the Facebook issue mentioned above, PayPal in 2016 did not validate the anti-CSRF token in paypal.me.

Then, he did the right thing: he reported it to Facebook. Melamed said in a blog post on Monday that he\u2019d discovered the critical vulnerability in June. Besides finding a kill switch for any public video, he also discovered he could disable commenting on any video. Melamed had looked at the HTTP request that his browser sends to Facebook when he uploads a video. Using a program called Fiddler, he intercepted the request, swapped out his video\u2019s ID for one belonging to a victim\u2019s video, and then sent the modified request on its way to Facebook. Melamed\u2019s method is simple: first, an attacker would either create a public event on Facebook or visit any existing public event. Then, they\u2019d go to the event\u2019s Discussion tab and create an event post by uploading a photo or video. He found that when you swap the value of the composer_unpublished_photo[0] parameter for the ID of the Facebook video you want to kill, the server will balk, putting out this error message: This content is no longer available. Error message or no error message, the video will still successfully attach itself to the created event post. When an attacker refreshes the Events Discussion page, they\u2019d see that the event posting had appeared with the victim\u2019s video attached. Then, it\u2019s just a matter of clicking a small arrow dropdown and choosing \u201cDelete Post\u201d. A dialog box will warn that the video will also be removed from Photos and Videos. If you confirm in the dialog box that yes, you want to delete the video, Poof! Credit where credit\u2019s due, Melamed noted that this vulnerability is similar to another video deletion bug that Indian security researcher and penetration tester Pranav Hivarekar discovered, also in June 2016. In a nutshell: whereas Hivarekar\u2019s flaw had to do with attaching a victim\u2019s video to a comment, Melamed discovered a way to attach the video to an event post. Delete the bath water/event post, and that baby/video gets tossed right out with it.

Check Point says one of its customers contracted the malware app, dubbed \"Charger,\" after installing what they thought was a battery monitoring tool called EnergyRescue. Researchers with Check Point Mobile Threat Prevention say the malware activates when EnergyRescue runs, and requires admin access to the device. Once that permission is granted, the malware checks for location (it does not attack phones in the Ukraine, Belarus, or Russia), then swipes all user contacts and SMS messages and locks down the device. From there, the user is told that they must pay to deactivate the ransomware or they will have their full details spaffed out for various nefarious activities, including bank fraud and spam. \"You need to pay for us, otherwise we will sell portion of your personal information on black market every 30 minutes,\" the ransomware tells users. Not ones to be unprofessional, the Charger operators attempt to reassure their victims by offering a \"100% guarantee\" that once the 0.2 Bitcoin ransom (currently around $183) is paid, all the collected information will be deleted and the device unlocked. \"The ransom demand for 0.2 Bitcoins is a much higher ransom demand than has been seen in mobile ransomware so far,\" note Check Point mobile security analysts Oren Koriat and Andrey Polkovnichenko. \"By comparison, the DataLust ransomware demanded merely $15.\" Check Point says that thus far it has not spotted any payments being registered to the Bitcoin address used for the ransom collection, so it is unclear how much, if anything, has been made from this operation.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: disguised as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: swipes, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: must pay to deactivate, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: need to pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: is paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom collection, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Data from that period backed up on DVDs and CDs remained intact. While archived data has its importance, more worrying is that the department lost data from ongoing investigations. In an interview with WFAA, who broke the story, Stephen Barlag, Cockrell Hill's police chief, said that none of the lost data was critical. The department also notified the Dallas County District Attorney's office of the incident. The department says the infection was discovered on December 12, last year, and the crooks asked for a $4,000 ransom fee to unlock the files. After consulting with the FBI's cyber-crime unit, the department decided to wipe their data server and reinstall everything. Data could not be recovered from backups, as the backup procedure kicked in shortly after the ransomware took root, and backed up copies of the encrypted files. According to the department's press release, the Cockrell Hill police IT staff said they were infected with the OSIRIS ransomware. It's quite possible that the department's server was infected with the Locky ransomware, which a few days prior had come out with a new version that appended the \".osiris\" extension at the end of encrypted files. The press release says the infection took place after an officer opened a spam message from a cloned (spoofed) email address imitating a department issued email address. The infection did not spread to other computers because the server was taken offline and disconnected from the local network as soon as staff discovered the ransom demand.

Ransomware for Android phones has already been around for several years and security experts have warned in the past that it's only a matter of time until such malicious programs start affecting smart TVs, especially since some of them also run Android. In November 2015, a Symantec researcher named Candid Wueest even went as far as to infect his own TV with an Android ransomware application to highlight the threat. While that infection was just a demonstration, this Christmas, the owner of an LG Electronics TV experienced the real deal. Kansas-based software developer Darren Cauthon reported on Twitter on Dec. 25 that a family member accidentally infected his Android-based TV with ransomware after downloading a movie-watching app. The picture shared by Cauthon showed the TV screen with an FBI-themed ransom message. On Android the majority of ransomware applications are so-called screen lockers. They work by displaying persistent messages on the phone's screen and preventing users from performing any other actions on their devices. The messages usually impersonate some law enforcement authority and ask victims to pay fictitious fines to regain control. Cauthon, who was the previous owner of the three-year-old TV, tried to help the new owner restore the device to its default factory settings, but didn't succeed even after receiving many suggestions and advice from other Twitter users. According to the software developer, when he first contacted LG's tech support, he was told that a technician would have to come over and take a look for a fee of around $340. The ransom amount itself was $500 although even paying that would have been difficult because there was no way to click on the payment section to find the instructions on how to do so. The only thing that worked was just moving a mouse-like pointer on a portion of the TV screen via an accompanying smart remote. Eventually LG provided Cauthon with a solution that involved pressing and releasing two physical buttons on the TV in a particular order. This booted the TV, which runs the now defunct Android-based Google TV platform, into a recovery mode. The Android recovery mode allows wiping the data partition, which deletes all user settings, apps and data and is the equivalent of a factory reset.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: impersonate, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: ask, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

If recovering from smart TV ransomware infections can be hard, imagine what users would have to deal with if these programs start infecting other internet-of-things devices, as some security experts predict. In this case, the victim was lucky because the ransomware app was only a screen locker and not a program that encrypts files.

The other still appears to be vulnerable. Before attempting to guess which app has yet to be patched, consider that Apache OpenOffice for years has struggled attract more contributors. And though the number of people adding code to the project has grown since last we checked, the project missed its recent January report to the Apache Foundation. The upshot is: security holes aren't being patched, it seems. The issue, identified by security researcher Alex Inf\u00fchr, is that there's a way to achieve remote code execution by triggering an event embedded in an ODT (OpenDocument Text) file. In a blog post on Friday, Inf\u00fchr explains how he found a way to abuse the OpenDocument scripting framework by adding an onmouseover event to a link in an ODT file. The event, which fires when a user's mouse pointer moves over the link, can traverse local directories and execute a local Python script. After trying various approaches to exploit the vulnerability, Inf\u00fchr found that he could rig the event to call a specific function within a Python file included with the Python interpreter that ships with LibreOffice. \"For the solution I looked into the Python parsing code a little more in depth and discovered that it is not only possible to specify the function you want to call inside a python script, but it is possible to pass parameters as well,\" he said. The exploit was tested on Windows, and should work on Linux, too. Inf\u00fchr says he reported the bug on October 18 and it was fixed in LibreOffice by the end of the month. RedHat assigned it CVE-2018-16858 in mid-November and gave Inf\u00fchr a disclosure date of January 31, 2019. When he published on February 1, in conjunction with the LibreOffice fix notification, OpenOffice still had not been patched. Inf\u00fchr says he reconfirmed that he could go ahead with disclosure even though OpenOffice 4.16 has yet to be fixed. His proof-of-concept exploit doesn't work with OpenOffice out-of-the-box because the software doesn't allow parameters to be passed in the same way as the unpatched version of LibreOffice did.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: affecting, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: being patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: identified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: explains, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: says, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: assigned, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: published, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: been patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: says, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: reconfirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Siemens AG on Tuesday issued a slew of fixes addressing eight vulnerabilities spanning its industrial product lines. The most serious of the patched flaws include a cross-site scripting vulnerability in Siemens\u2019 SCALANCE firewall product. The flaw could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to industrial networks and ultimately put operations and production at risk. The SCALANCE S firewall is used to protect secure industrial networks from untrusted network traffic, and allows filtering incoming and outgoing network connections in different ways. Siemens S602, S612, S623, S627-2M SCALANCE devices with software versions prior to V4.0.1.1 are impacted. Researchers with Applied Risk, who discovered the flaw, said that vulnerability exists in the web server of the firewall software. An attacker can carry out the attack by crafting a malicious link and tricking an administrator \u2013 who is logged into the web server \u2013 to click that link. Once an admin does so, the attacker can execute commands on the web server, on the administrator\u2019s behalf. \u201cThe integrated web server allows a cross-site scripting attack if an administrator is misled into accessing a malicious link,\u201d Applied Risk researcher Nelson Berg said in an analysis of the flaw. \u201cSuccessful exploitation may lead to the ability to bypass critical security measures provided by the firewall.\u201d Exploitation of this vulnerability could ultimately enable threat actors to bypass critical security functions provided by the firewall, potentially providing access to industrial networks and putting operations and production at risk. The vulnerability, CVE-2018-16555, has a CVSS score which Applied Risk researcher calculates to be 8.2 (or high severity). That said, researchers said a successful exploit is not completely seamless and takes some time and effort to carry out \u2013 for an attacker to exploit the flaw, user interaction is required and the administrator must be logged into the web interface. Researchers said that no exploit of the vulnerability has been discovered thus far. Siemens addressed the reported vulnerability by releasing a software update (V4.0.1.1) and also advised customers to \u201conly access links from trusted sources in the browser you use to access the SCALANCE S administration website.\u201d The industrial company also released an array of fixes for other vulnerabilities on Tuesday.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: addressing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: gain unauthorized access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: are impacted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exists in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: crafting, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: tricking, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: is misled, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: said in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: analysis, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: calculates, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has been discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: releasing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Another serious vulnerability (CVE-2018-16556) addressed was an improper input validation flaw in certain Siemens S7-400 CPUs. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could crash the device being accessed which may require a manual reboot or firmware re-image to bring the system back to normal operation, according to the advisory. \u201cSpecially crafted packets sent to Port 102/TCP via Ethernet interface, via PROFIBUS, or via multi-point interfaces (MPI) could cause the affected devices to go into defect mode. Manual reboot is required to resume normal operation,\u201d according to US Cert. An improper access control vulnerability that is exploitable remotely in Siemens IEC 61850 system configurator, DIGSI 5, DIGSI 4, SICAM PAS/PQS, SICAM PQ Analyzer, and SICAM SCC, was also mitigated. The vulnerability, CVE-2018-4858, has a CVSS of 4.2 and exists in a service of the affected products listening on all of the host\u2019s network interfaces on either Port 4884/TCP, Port 5885/TCP, or Port 5886/TCP. The service could allow an attacker to either exfiltrate limited data from the system or execute code with Microsoft Windows user permissions. Also mitigated were an improper authentication vulnerability (CVE-2018-13804) in SIMATIC IT Production Suite and a code injection vulnerability(CVE-2018-13814) in SIMATIC Panels and SIMATIC WinCC that  could allow an attacker with network access to the web server to perform a HTTP header injection attack.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: addressed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: is exploitable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: mitigated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: exists in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exfiltrate, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: mitigated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Officially, Adobe patches security vulnerabilities around the middle of each month to coordinate with Microsoft\u2019s Patch Tuesday, but recently it\u2019s become almost routine for the company to issue out-of-band updates in between. APSB19-02, the first of such updates to reach customers in the new year, addresses critical flaws with a priority rating of \u20182\u2019. That means that the flaw is potentially serious, but Adobe hasn\u2019t detected any real-world exploits (the latter would entail issuing an \u2018emergency\u2019 patch with a \u20181\u2019 rating). The first flaw, identified as CVE-2018-16011, is described by Adobe as a use-after-free bug that could be exploited using a maliciously crafted PDF to take control of a target system with their malware of choice. The second, CVE-2018-16018 (replacing CVE-2018-19725), is a security bypass targeting JavaScript API restrictions on Adobe Reader DC and seems to have been in the works since before Christmas, affecting all versions of Window and macOS Acrobat DC/Reader 2019.010.20064 and earlier, the fix in both cases is to update to 2019.010.20069. For the legacy Acrobat/Reader 2017 2017.011.30110 and Acrobat/Reader DC 2015 2015.006.30461, the updates take those to 2017.011.30113 and 2015.006.30464 respectively. As critical flaws with a \u20182\u2019 rating, there is a suggested 30-day window within which to apply the updates, but it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that a new round of patches will likely be offered for Adobe products tomorrow as part of Patch Tuesday. In December\u2019s Patch Tuesday, Adobe released a not inconsiderable 87 patches, including 39 rated critical.

Apple's latest iOS 12.1.4 release, issued earlier today, contains fixes for Foundation and IOKit flaws that, according to security researcher Ben Hawkes, were used to hack devices in the wild. As noted by ZDNet, Hawkes, leader of Google's Project Zero security team, shared the revelation on Twitter late Thursday, saying the iOS bugs were leveraged as zero-day vulnerabilities. How, exactly, the vulnerabilities were exploited and by whom is unknown. Both bugs were detailed in Apple documentation detailing security changes delivered with the iOS 12.1.4 package. Logged with the identifier CVE-2019-7286, the Foundation flaw involves a memory corruption issue that could allow an app to gain elevated privileges in iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation. An anonymous researcher, Clement Lecigne of Google Threat Analysis Group, Ian Beer of Google Project Zero and Samuel Grob of Google Project Zero were credited with finding the flaw. The second bug, identified as CVE-2019-7287, also involves a memory corruption, but instead of granting elevated privileges it allows an app to executive code with kernel privileges on iPhone 5s and later, iPad Air and later, and iPod touch 6th generation. The same researchers were credited with the find. Apple released iOS 12.1.4 alongside a supplemental update to macOS Mojave to address the widely publicized FaceTime flaw that allowed interlopers to eavesdrop on Group FaceTime calls.

Speaking to the Boston Globe, the US arm of the non-profit, which supports children worldwide, said that con artists managed to compromise an employee's email account in order to masquerade as the staff member in question. Once access was gained to the account, the hackers behind the scam created a number of false invoices and related documents which described a need to purchase solar panels for health centers located in Pakistan. The Connecticut-based charity organization fell for the ruse, conducted in May 2017, and approved the transfer of close to $1 million to an entity in Japan which was used as a front to rake in the proceeds. By the time the foundation realized the invoice was false, it was too late and the money was gone. The publication says that Save the Children possessed insurance which covered close to all of the lost funds, and in the end, the charity only lost $112,000. \"We have improved our security measures to help ensure this does not happen again,\" Stacy Brandom, the chief financial officer of Save the Children told the Globe. \"Fortunately, through insurance, we were ultimately reimbursed for most of the funds.\" The scammers targeting the charity appeared to follow the rules of Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks almost to the letter. These campaigns have a number of steps, compromise a business email account via brute-force hacking or social engineering; pretend to be a legitimate staff member, and lure another individual to approve false invoices or fraudulent payments. The FBI has previously warned that December 2016 and May 2018, there was a 136 percent increase in BEC scams, reported across 150 countries, Ill-gotten funds are often sent to entities in Asia and billions of dollars have been lost. In February, IBM said a single BEC scam originating in Nigeria led to the loss of millions of dollars belonging to Fortune 500 companies. These types of scams are incredibly common and it can be difficult to track down the fraudsters responsible, who may be located in any country in the world.

The cryptovirus, which some people say first reared its head in August of last year, has primarily focused its attacks on mining farms in China, the country with the highest number of mining farms. The ransomware, in a note written in both English and Chinese, has threatened to turn off the mining unit\u2019s fan and compromise its overheating protection and by extension, the safety and integrity of the mining unit. To remove the ransomware, the culprit behind the strain has demanded either a ransom of 10 BTC to be paid or a malicious software that could potentially infect thousands be downloaded by the victim. Although nobody is sure how these mining rigs came to be infected, it has been suggested by some that tainted rig firmware may have been the culprit. On the other hand, some also believe that the culprit has merely taken advantage of the vulnerability of mining equipment that is usually overclocked by mining pools to boost hash power and processing speeds. Presently, Antminer S9 and T9 devices are the worst affected mining equipment. As of now, there haven\u2019t been any reports of the cryptohackers actually going ahead with the threat and destroying mining rigs, which would suggest this being an empty threat. That being said, the mere fact of infection has led to several financial losses accruing from many mining operations shutting down temporarily, mining equipment being reflashed or tainted firmware simply being replaced by a new one. Bitmain, the company that manufactures much of the Antminer equipment, that has come under the attack of hAnt has for its part, came forward and cautioned users against visiting untrusted third-party sites and downloading anything outside of Bitmain.

Del Rio's Management Information Services (MIS) department then attempted to isolate the malware by turning off all Internet connections for other city departments. In turn, this prevented any members of staff from logging into government systems. As a result, employees of each department were forced to use pen and paper in their work and go back to manual entry for transactions taking place -- as and when they could considering there was no access to historical records -- while the ransomware was contained. City officials have informed the FBI of the cyberattack and the Secret Service has now become involved in attempts to find out who is responsible. It is not known at present who is behind the ransomware, what kind of malware is at fault, or whether or not any personal data has been compromised. The Texan city has also not revealed how much the ransomware demanded in payment, as is usually the case with this particular form of malware. Ransoms are usually requested in return for a decryption key -- which may or may not work -- in order to unlock encrypted systems and restore access. However, a Del Rio City Hall spokeswoman did reveal that the malware is somewhat unusual, as the ransom note posted to roughly 30 - 45 PCs contained a phone number to be used to pay the blackmail fee. Most of the time, a note will be posted on a landing page containing instructions for paying ransom in cryptocurrency and victims will be given a wallet address, rather than a means to directly call the malware's operator. \"The City is diligently working on finding the best solution to resolve this situation and restore the system,\" an official statement reads. \"We ask the public to be patient with us as we may be slower in processing requests at this time.\"[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was struck, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: been compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: demanded in payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: Ransoms, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the blackmail, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The media company, which runs a stable of TV and radio channels, newspapers, advertising and digital media companies was hit by a ransomware attack last Thursday (Nov 8), The Edge Financial Daily reported. Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid. The report, quoting a source, said the attackers are demanding 1,000 bitcoins to release access to the computer systems. This means that the attackers are demanding a ransom of RM26.42 million (S$8.71 million). Media Prima is listed on Bursa Malaysia's main board. It operates, among others, three national newspapers, namely New Straits Times, Berita Harian and Harian Metro; free-to-air television stations, namely TV3, TV9, ntv7 and 8TV; and four radio stations, namely Fly FM, Hot FM, One FM and Kool FM. When contacted, Media Prima group managing director, Datuk Kamal Khalid, declined to comment when asked to confirm whether the company has been hit by ransomware. He urged The Star to get in touch with the company's corporate communications department for comments, and efforts are ongoing to contact the department. The Edge Financial Daily report said it was not immediately known whether Media Prima's data has been breached, and whether the media group would be suffering financial losses due to the ransomware attack. It quoted another source saying that Media Prima's office e-mail has been affected but that the company has migrated the email to another system. The source reportedly added that Media Prima has decided not to pay the ransom.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: are demanding, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: was hit by a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: money is paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: are demanding, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: are demanding a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: has been hit, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: has been breached, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Hackers took addresses, dates of birth, Social Security details and credit card numbers from 148million people when they targeted the credit ratings giant Equifax in 2017.  But the stolen data has not appeared on any 'dark web' sites which sell personal information for sinister use, analysts have said.  The data's apparent disappearance has led some experts to conclude that it is in the hands of a foreign government, CNBC reported. One analyst told the channel: 'We are all working to be able to consistently determine whether this data is out there and whether it has ever been out there. And at this time there has been absolutely no indication, whatsoever, that the data has been disclosed, that it has been used or that it has been offered for sale. Another ex-intelligence worker said personal data could be used by foreign governments to identify powerful people who were having financial problems. Those people would be prime targets for a bribe or might be attracted by a job offer, he said.  It has also been suggested that the criminals who stole the data feared detection if they sold it online and have kept it to themselves to avoid capture.    Equifax, one of America's three leading consumer reporting agencies, announced the huge data hack in September 2017 and its CEO Richard Smith resigned later that month. They initially said 143million people had been affected but the number eventually grew to 148million, equivalent to nearly half the U.S. population.  The hackers targeted the company for 76 days until the attack was spotted, according to a congressional report.   Hackers gained access to 48 databases between May 13 and July 29 when Equifax noticed the intrusion, the report said.    Last year the firm admitted that passport images and information had also been stolen.  The U.S. House committee which investigated the breach said the firm had 'failed to fully appreciate and mitigate its cybersecurity risks'.  'Had the company taken action to address its observable security issues prior to this cyberattack, the data breach could have been prevented,' the committee's report said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: took, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stole, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: hack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: gained access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: been stolen, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: address, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

In describing a phishing attack, UConn Health says that on Dec 24, 2018, it determined that an unauthorized third party illegally accessed a limited number of employee email accounts containing patient information, including some individuals' names, dates of birth, addresses and limited medical information, such as billing and appointment information. The accounts also contained the Social Security numbers of some individuals. Several other healthcare entities also have recently reported to federal regulators data breaches involving apparent phishing and other email-related attacks. \"All of these incidents speak to the rampant attacks we are seeing across healthcare, and yet organizations are still not investing enough in protection or detection,\" says Mac McMillan, CEO of security consulting firm CynergisTek.   UConn Health, an academic medical center, says in a media statement that it identified approximately 326,000 potentially impacted individuals whose personal information was contained in the compromised email accounts. For approximately 1,500 of these individuals, this information included Social Security numbers. \"It is important to note that, at this point, UConn Health does not know for certain if any personal information was ever viewed or acquired by the unauthorized party, and is not aware of any instances of fraud or identity theft as a result of this incident,\" the statement notes. \"The incident had no impact on UConn Health's computer networks or electronic medical record systems.\" UConn Health is offering prepaid identity theft protection services to individuals whose Social Security numbers may be impacted. The organization says it has notified law enforcement officials and retained a forensics firm to investigate the matter.  Once the U.S.Department of Health and Human Services confirms the details, the attack on UConn Health could rank as the second largest health data breach reported so far this year, based on a snapshot of its HIPAA Breach Reporting Tool website on Monday. The largest health data breach revealed so far this year, but not yet added to the tally, affected University of Washington Medicine. UW Medicine says a misconfigured database left patient data exposed on the internet for several weeks last December, resulting in a breach affecting 974,000 individuals.  Several other phishing and hacking incidents have been added to the HHS \"wall of shame\" tally in recent weeks.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: health data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: illegally accessed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: viewed or acquired, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: attack, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: health data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: health data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

In a statement, the organization notes that on Dec 5, 2018, it discovered it had been the target of a \"criminal malware attack.\" An RMIA practice manager tells Information Security Media Group that independent computer forensics experts removed the malware, but did not definitively determine how the malware infection was launched. The practice suspects the malware was likely embedded in an email attachment, he says. RMIA's statement notes that while the investigation did not identify any evidence of unauthorized access to anyone's personal information, \"we unfortunately could not completely rule out the possibility that patients' personal information, including name, address, date of birth, health insurance information, limited treatment information and, for donors only, Social Security number, may have been accessible.\" In the aftermath of the incident, RMIA says it's adding another firewall, requiring changes to user credentials/passwords, implementing dual-factor authentication and providing additional staff training regarding information security.\"  Also reporting a hacking incident in recent weeks was Charleston, S.C.-based Roper St.Francis Healthcare, which operates several hospitals in the region. The attack was reported as impacting nearly 35,300 individuals. In a Jan 29 statement, the entity says that on Nov 30, 2018, it learned that an unauthorized actor may have gained access to some of its employees' email accounts between Nov 15 and Dec 1, 2018 , \"Our investigation determined that some patient information may have been contained in the email accounts, patients' names, medical record numbers, information about services they received from Roper St.Francis, health insurance information, and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and financial information,\" the statement says. For those patients whose Social Security number was potentially exposed, the organization is offering prepaid credit monitoring and identity protection services. \"To help prevent something like this from happening again, we are continuing education with our staff on email protection and enhancing our email security,\" Roper St. Francis says.  As phishing continues to menace healthcare entities, covered entities and business associates need to keep up with their defenses, some experts note. \"Phishing techniques have become more sophisticated than in the past,\" note Kate Borten, president of security and privacy consulting firm The Marblehead Group.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: unauthorized access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: been accessible, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: gained access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

So what other technologies or best practices should covered entities and business associates consider to prevent falling victim to phishing and other attacks? \"Unfortunately we haven't seen any silver bullets here yet, but one thing we might want to begin exploring is just what an attacker has access to when they compromise a user's account,\" McMillan notes. \"All too often, we hear that the accounts compromised had incredibly large numbers of emails immediately accessible to the attacker.

I'm willing to bet many at Apple are trying hard to forget it right now as news breaks of a vulnerability in the group functionality of its FaceTime application that allows users to eavesdrop on the people being called, even if they didn't pick up the call! The shockingly simple exploit works with any pair of iOS devices running iOS 12.1 or later. \"The bug lets you call anyone with FaceTime, and immediately hear the audio coming from their phone - before the person on the other end has accepted or rejected the incoming call\" according to Benjamin Mayo at 9to5Mac who first broke the story and adds \"there's a second part to this which can expose video too...\" The exploit really is stupidly easy to pull off, essentially just requiring the caller to add their own number while a call is dialing in order to start a group chat that includes themselves and the audio of the person being called. It doesn't matter if the recipient has accepted the call or not, all audio captured while the iPhone is ringing can be heard by the caller. If the recipient presses the power button from the lockscreen, used to accept or reject the incoming FaceTime chat, then video is also sent to the caller. One user, @Jessassin, tweeted that if you join the call using your invitation on another iPhone then you also get the video stream despite the call not being answered on the destination device. What's more, the bug isn't limited to iPhone users and if the recipient is using a Mac then, as it rings for a longer default than a handset, the eavesdropping can potentially continue for a longer period. This is particularly worrying as a Mac user may well be away from the device for a long, certainly more so than we are from our smartphones, and during that time anyone could be listening in on whatever was happening in that house or office. So, what do you need to do now? The good news is that Apple has responded by temporarily suspending the Group FaceTime functionality until a permanent fix can be rolled out.

This is because there are certain bugs in older Samsung Galaxy phones and tablets that can be triggered via SMS, and used by attackers to force maliciously crafted configuration messages onto the users\u2019 device. The bugs allow these types of messages to be executed without user interaction. As the ContextIS researchers who discovered the vulnerabilities explained, this avenue of attack can be abused by crooks to hold users\u2019 devices for ransom. \u201cFirst a ransom note is sent, if ignored then the malicious configuration message can be sent,\u201d they noted. If the victim pays up, a configuration message can later be sent to stop the rebooting. The vulnerabilities in question, CVE-2016-7988 and CVE-2016-7989, can be triggered through SMS on the S4, S4 Mini, S5 and Note 4, but not on newer Samsung devices. \u201cIt\u2019s worth noting that although newer phones such as the S6 and S7 aren\u2019t affected over the air, [a similar result] could be accomplished by a malicious app abusing CVE-2016-7988,\u201d they added. These specific issues are related to modifications Samsung made to to the Android telephony framework and are found in a Samsung-specific application for handling carrier messages. \u201cWe responsibly disclosed this to Samsung who handle the patching process with carriers. We extended our standard 90 day disclosure policy to allow Samsung time to arrange for the patches to be made available,\u201d the researchers told Help Net Security. Whether all users of vulnerable devices have received the patches is difficult to tell. \u201cThe Android update process is a bit of a minefield and is well illustrated in this HTC diagram,\u201d they commented.

According to a report posted by Shodan, the Heartbleed vulnerability first exposed in April 2014 was still found in 199,594 internet-accessible devices during a scan it performed last weekend. But according to open-source security firm Black Duck, about 11% of more than 200 applications it audited between Oct  2015 and March 2016 contained the flaw, which enables a buffer overread that endangers data from clients and servers running affected versions of OpenSSL. The company\u2019s vice president of security strategy Mike Pittenger says it\u2019s likely most of those machines have been remediated, but it doesn\u2019t address the countless other applications \u2013 commercial and proprietary - Black Duck didn\u2019t audit. \u201cHowever, I would not extrapolate that to say 11% of all commercial applications were vulnerable to Heartbleed at that time\u201d. That 11% is a number from the company\u2019s last published report. In a new report due out next month that hasn\u2019t been wrapped up yet, that number is likely to dip into the single digits, but is still significant. The problem is that commercial software in general uses a great deal of open source code \u2013 35% on average - and authors of the code don\u2019t necessarily have processes in place to track when vulnerabilities are found in that code and to then patch them, he says. He says Black Duck\u2019s study finds that two-thirds of these applications have open-source vulnerabilities of one kind or another and that they average 5 years old. In regard to Heartbleed in particular, he says the reports draw on anonymized data about its audits so they don\u2019t reveal the specific applications in which the Heartbleed vulnerability was found. Running vulnerable applications in a regulated environment could have consequences for the enterprises using them, he says, because the security threat they represent could violate HIPAA or PCI security and privacy requirements. The Shodan report on the prevalence of Heartbleed showed that the individual entities hosting the largest number of Heartbleed-vulnerable devices were service providers. That may be because these machines were set up a while ago and are no longer in use but were never taken offline, Pittenger says.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: recently discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: a report posted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: first exposed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was still found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: contained, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: Black Duck\u2019s study, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: finds, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: don\u2019t reveal, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Officials told the Washington Post that 123 out of a network of 187 cameras were affected. The devices are apparently used run by the police to monitor public spaces. The attack targeted 70% of the storage systems on which camera data is recorded, leaving them out of action from 12 to 15 January, the report claimed. However, the issue was resolved by removing each device\u2019s software and reinstalling at each site. There are said to have been at least two forms of ransomware on the system, although local officials have played down the seriousness of the attack. The ransomware was isolated to the CCTV network and didn\u2019t affect police investigations or put public safety in jeopardy, according to the report. In related news, police in Texas have lost nearly eight years\u2019 worth of digital evidence after refusing to pay a ransomware fine. The Cockerell Hill Police Department in south Dallas decided after speaking to the FBI not to pay the near $4000 ransom after discovering the malware in mid-December. The ransomware was introduced to the network via a spam email spoofed to imitate a department-issued address. A statement published by WFAA last week has the following: \u201cThis virus affected all Microsoft Office Suite documents, such as Word documents and Excel files. In addition, all body camera video, some in-car video, some in-house surveillance video, and some photographs that were stored on the server were corrupted and were lost.

So much so that they have become a powerful instrument of aggression against public entities and citizens. They can lead to a serious deterioration in the quality of service, and also, above all, to data leaks concerning everything from personal information to state secrets. The combination of new technologies and the increase in the complexity of attacks, as well as the professionalization of cybercriminals, is highly dangerous. Last December, a large-scale spam campaign spanning more than ten countries was carried out, and specifically targeted a major European ministry. The attack, via phishing, was highly advanced and combined social engineering tactics with a powerful Trojan. The attack is sent by email with an attached Word document. At first, we suspected that it was a targeted attack, since the message came, supposedly, from a healthcare company and the recipient was an employee of the Ministry of Health in a European country.

Netflix has 93 million subscribers in more than 190 countries. It's a popular app, but many people aren't willing to pay the monthly subscription fee. They'll try to bypass the cost and watch content for free - and cybercriminals are now taking advantage of them. This newly detected ransomware, RANSOM_NETIX.A, aims to trick Windows PC users with a login generator typically used for software and account membership piracy. Victims click a \"Generate Login\" button to kick-start the encryption process. The ransomware uses fake login prompts as a distraction while it encrypts 39 file types under the C:\\Users directory. The program then demands $100 in Bitcoin from victims. While it targets Windows users, it's worth noting the ransomware destroys itself on systems not running Windows 7 or Windows 10. Netflix, with its massive user base, presents a tempting opportunity for hackers to exploit vulnerabilities, infect systems to steal user data, and monetize data on the dark Web. Stolen credentials can be used to bargain among criminals or trick victims into installing malware, which can generate profit. \"We regularly see threat actors utilize popular apps or services as a lure to get victims to infect themselves,\" explains Jon Clay, global director of threat communications at Trend Micro. \"Also, by using imagery that is similar to the real vendor's imagery, [criminals] trick the victim into thinking it's real.\" Clay says this discovery marks a continuation of 2016 ransomware trends, which included the creation of new tactics to generate more victims. After seeing nearly 750% growth in new ransomware families in 2016, Trend Micro predicted 25% growth in new families for 2017. The Netflix scam carries implications for how ransomware will evolve later in the year. \"We will likely see other popular vendors targeted with their brands, especially if the actors behind [the Netflix scam] find success,\" he continues. \"They will use this tactic again with other vendors.\" This is a wake-up call for potential victims to protect their accounts. Best practices include regularly updating account credentials, employing two-factor authentication, limiting downloads to official sources, and being wary of illegitimate emails.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Accoridng to a press release, once the Cockrell Hill Police Department became aware that files on the server had been corrupted by a computer virus, they immediately disconnected the server and all computers from the internet and all state database systems and were able to contain the virus. The virus had been introduced onto the network from a spam email that had come from a cloned email address imitating a department issued email address. An internet webpage showed that if the police department paid $4,000 in Bitcoin, then the police department's online contents would be released. The FBI Cybercrimes unit recommended that the police department isolate and wipe the virus from the servers. This virus affected all Microsoft Office Suite documents, such as Word documents and Excel files. In addition, all body camera video, some in-car video, some in-house surveillance video, and some photographs that were stored on the server were corrupted and were lost, the police department stated in its release.

Despite this fact, many manufacturers of home routers fail to properly audit their devices for security issues before releasing them to the market. As security researchers, we are often disappointed to rediscover that this is not always the case, and that sometimes these vulnerabilities simply fall into our hands during our day-to-day lives. Such is the story of the two NETGEAR vulnerabilities I want to share with you today: It was a cold and rainy winter night, almost a year ago, when my lovely NETGEAR VEGN2610 modem/router lost connection to the Internet. I was tucked in bed, cozy and warm, there was no way I was going downstairs to reset the modem, \"I will just reboot it through the web panel\" I thought to myself. Unfortunately I couldn't remember the password and it was too late at night to check whether my roommates had it. I considered my options: Needless to say, I chose the latter. I thought to myself, \"Well, it has a web interface and I need to bypass the authentication somehow, so the web server is a good start.\" I started manually fuzzing the web server with different parameters, I tried \"../..\" classic directory traversal and such, and after about 1 minute of fuzzing, I tried \"\u2026\" and I got this response: Fig 1: unauth.cgi \"Hmm, what is that unauth.cgi thingy? Luckily for me the Internet connection had come back on its own, but I was now a man on a mission, so I started to look around to see if there were any known vulnerabilities for my VEGN2610. I started looking up what that \"unauth.cgi\" page could be, and I found 2 publicly disclosed exploits from 2014, for different models that manage to do unauthenticated password disclosure. Those two guys found out that the number we get from unauth.cgi can be used with passwordrecovered.cgi to retrieve the credentials. I tested the method described in both, and voila - I have my password, now I can go to sleep happy and satisfied. I woke up the next morning excited by the discovery, I thought to myself: \"3 routers with same issue\u2026 Coincidence?[/INST]\n\nTrigger: want to share, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: 2 publicly disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found out, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

I started asking people I knew if they have NETGEAR equipment so I could test further to see the scope of the issue. In order to make life easier for non-technical people I wrote a python script called netgore, similar to wnroast, to test for this issue. I am aware of that and that is why I don't work as a full time programmer. As it turned out, I had an error in my code where it didn't correctly take the number from unauth.cgi and passed gibberish to passwordrecovered.cgi instead, but somehow it still managed to get the credentials! After few trials and errors trying to reproduce the issue, I found that the very first call to passwordrecovered.cgi will give out the credentials no matter what the parameter you send. This is totally new bug that I haven't seen anywhere else. When I tested both bugs on different NETGEAR models, I found that my second bug works on a much wider range of models.

The Responsible Disclosure Process This is where the story of discovery ends and the story of disclosure begins. Following our Responsible Disclosure policy we sent both findings to NETGEAR in the beginning of April 2016. In our initial contact, the first advisory had 18 models listed as vulnerable, although six of them didn't have the vulnerability in the latest firmware. Perhaps it was fixed as part of a different patch cycle. The second advisory included 25 models, all of which were vulnerable in their latest firmware version. In June NETGEAR published a notice that provided a fix for a small subset of vulnerable routers and a workaround for the rest. They also made the commitment to working toward 100% coverage for all affected routers. The notice has been updated several time since then and currently contains 31 vulnerable models, 18 of which are patched now, and 2 models that they previously listed as vulnerable, but are now listed as not vulnerable.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been assigned, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: both findings, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: listed as vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: provided, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: are patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: listed as vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: listed as not vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Over the past nine months we attempted to contact NETGEAR multiple times for clarification and to allow them time to patch more models. Over that time we have found more vulnerable models that were not listed in the initial notice, although they were added later. We also discovered that the Lenovo R3220 router is powered by NETGEAR firmware and it was vulnerable as well. Luckily NETGEAR did eventually get back to us right before we were set to disclose these vulnerabilities publicly. We were a little skeptical since our experience to date matched that of other third-party vulnerability researchers that have tried to responsibly disclose to NETGEAR only to be met with frustration. The first was that NETGEAR committed to pushing out firmware to the currently unpatched models on an aggressive timeline. The second change made us more confident that NETGEAR was not just serious about patching these vulnerabilities, but serious about changing how they handle third-party disclosure in general. We fully expect this move will not only smooth the relationship between third-party researchers and NETGEAR, but, in the end, will result in a more secure line of products and services. For starters, it affects a large number of models. We have found more than ten thousand vulnerable devices that are remotely accessible.

Researchers said that\u00a0while anyone who has physical access to a router can exploit the vulnerabilities locally, the real threat is that the flaw can also be exploited remotely. According to Simon Kenin, a security researcher with Trustwave\u2019s Spiderlabs team, who discovered the flaw and disclosed it Monday, the vulnerabilities can be remotely exploited if the router\u2019s remote management option is enabled. While Netgear claims remote management is turned off on routers by default, Kenin said\u00a0there are \u201chundreds of thousands, if not over a million\u201d devices left remotely accessible. Kenin claims that all he had to do was send a simple request to the router\u2019s web management server to retrieve a router\u2019s password. After determining a number that corresponds to a password recovery token, he found he could pair it with a call to the router\u2019s passwordrecovered.cgi script. Kenin claims he made his discovery by leveraging two exploits disclosed in 2014 on some Netgear routers he had hanging around. It wasn\u2019t until after Kenin pieced together a python script designed to diagnose the scope of the issue that he determined he could still retrieve the router\u2019s credentials even if he didn\u2019t send the correct password recovery token. \u201cAfter few trials and errors trying to reproduce the issue, I found that the very first call to passwordrecovered.cgi will give out the credentials no matter what the parameter you send.

The point is, Delta has plenty of resources to ensure that its systems don't just \"stop working.\" The second piece of the puzzle is that Delta's issues come one week after a similarly ambiguous glitch brought down the computer system at United Airlines, a subsidiary of United Continental Holdings (NYSE:UAL). Like Delta, United Airlines has tens of thousands of employees and earns tens of billions of dollars in annual revenue. While it's impossible to say for sure if there's a connection between these two incidents, as neither company has explained why their computers crashed, there's reason to be suspicious that they weren't simply innocent failures of technology. In the course of researching cyber-threats to banks, I spoke last week with\u00a0John Carlin, the former assistant attorney general for national security at the Department of Justice and one-time chief of staff at the FBI. There are few people who know as much about cyber-threats today as Carlin, as is clear if you watch his appearance on The Charlie Rose Show here. Carlin pointed out both to me and to Rose that cyber attacks are waged against the American government and companies all the time. At the FBI, they even have a room with an enormous monitor mounted on the wall that tracks attacks in real time. One of the stories Carlin shared was about the time that the People's Liberation Army of China was caught routinely hacking into American corporations' computers to steal trade secrets. \"One time they stole the pricing information from a solar company so they could price-dump,\" the former law-enforcement officer explained.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stole, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Or, in the case of a sustained cyber attack on four dozen U.S. banks from 2011 through 2013, which was traced back to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, systems can be disrupted in retaliation for cyber attacks conducted by our own intelligence agencies, as news reports speculated at the time. To get back to Delta Air Lines and United Airlines, then, it doesn't seem like an unreasonable stretch of the imagination to assume that the unexplained computer outages at the two companies weren't a coincidence at all, but instead the result of cyber attacks.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: stole, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransom payments, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Jens\u00a0M\u00fcller from the Ruhr-Universit\u00e4t Bochum in Germany published multiple advisories on vulnerabilities that he had discovered as part of his Master's degree thesis on the security of printers. The vulnerabilites stem from vendors not separating page description languages such as PostScript and PJL/PCL used to generate the output from printer control. \"Potentially harmful commands can be executed by anyone who has the right to print,\"\u00a0M\u00fcller said. M\u00fcller\u00a0outlined multiple attacks on his Hacking Printers wiki, ranging from accessing print jobs to credentials disclosure and bypassing device security, and included proofs of concept. HP LaserJet 1200, 4200N and 4250N as well as Dell 3130cn and Samsung Multipress 6345N have a vulnerable line printer daemon (LPD) service that cannot handle usernames with 150 or more characters. Sending a long username to the LPD service on the above devices crashes the printer, requiring manual restart to bring it back up. M\u00fcller said with correct shellcode and return address, the vulnerability could be used for remote code execution. More printers than the above are likely to be vulnerable, he said. It is even possible to launch denial of service attacks against printers that support PJL, and permanently damage the non-volatile random access memory (NVRAM) that is used to persistently store settings for the devices,\u00a0M\u00fcller found. He tested the NVRAM destruction attack on printers from Brother, Konica Minolta, Lexmark, Dell and HP, and verified that they are vulnerable.

Last year, user Y, who is based in Brazil, lost R$600 (US$191.02, as of January 30, 2017) as a side effect of information theft. Upon discovering this, Y immediately called an IT technician to find the root cause. But since no malware was found in the devices connected to the network, he then reviewed the home router settings. What he found was interesting:\u00a0 even though the home router did not expose any remote management interface to the internet, the DNS settings were still modified. In another case, user X noticed R$3,000 (US$955.11, as of January 30, 2017) was deducted from her account last January 2016. Her home router was also infected with a malicious DNS-changing malware.

It is also possible to personalize the messages sent via iMessage with a variety of animations using other Apple apps. This particular app is compatible with iOS, watchOS and macOS. Basically, it is a very widely used app by iPhone users. So when there is a bug in the app that is so severe that it can crash the phone easily, then users are bound to get concerned. According to reports, there is a nefarious text message that is being sent to iPhone users even on those phones that run on the latest iOS 10. This message is quite troublesome for users because it has the power to crash their phones within minutes. The new iMessage hack lets the attackers disable the Message app through sending an extensive contact record. This record file is pretty huge so as soon as the user taps on the recorded message, it immediately over-burdens the OS and terminates the app. The problem is that iPad and iPhone users who use iOS8 to iOS10.2.1 versions cannot do anything to prevent this assault. The most disturbing part of the hack is that it is very difficult to prevent or avoid unless the recipient of the message is aware of what is to be done. Generally, users reboot their device or restart the iMessage app, which certainly doesn\u2019t resolve the issue. Another aspect to be noted is that this hack can be distributed by the victim himself to other contacts. Here is how it can be done: Download the contact file, upload the contacts in dropbox or iCloud Drive, share this file using iMessage to the person you want to get hacked, wait until the victim taps on it and\u00a0the app will instantly freeze.

Company officials called IMPD Monday afternoon to report the breach, which apparently resulted from an email phishing scam. According to the police report, an individual posing as company CEO Scott Wise sent an email to a payroll account employee. The email requested the employee to send all 4,000 employees W-2 forms in PDF form. Chris Martin, director of HR/Payroll for the company, told police the email did not really come from Wise. However, the payroll account employee did email all 4,000 W-2 forms to the unknown individual. The report says Martin contacted the IRS to inform the agency of the breach. The IRS recommended Martin also file a report with IMPD. Scotty\u2019s Brewhouse officials are now in the process of informing all employees, and providing them with precautionary measures to take in order to protect their financial and personal information. The company says it will offer\u00a0one year of credit monitoring at no cost to employees, in addition to providing information regarding available resources for its employees to monitor their credit. Scotty\u2019s says\u00a0no customer information was obtained during the phishing scam. The company is working with\u00a0law enforcement and the credit bureaus to limit any potential misuse of the information that was obtained and to identify and apprehend the scammers. Scott Wise, CEO of Scotty\u2019s Holdings, LLC, issued the following statement: \u201cUnfortunately, Scotty\u2019s was the target of and fell victim to scammers, as so many other companies have,\u201d said Wise. \u201cScotty\u2019s employees and customers are of tremendous importance to the company and Scotty\u2019s regrets any inconvenience to its employees that may result from this scamming incident. Scotty\u2019s will continue to work with federal and local law enforcement, the Internal Revenue Service and credit bureaus to bring the responsible party or parties to justice\u201d.

What the WordPress team didn\u2019t share at that time is that the update also secretly fixes a bug that allows unauthenticated users to modify the content of any post or page within a WordPress site. The vulnerability was discovered by Sucuri researcher Marc-Alexandre Montpas and responsibly disclosed to the WordPress security team on January 20. A fix was soon created, tested, and included in the security update pushed out on January 26. The team reached out to makers of web application firewalls (WAFs) like SiteLock, Cloudflare, and Incapsula to help them create rules that would block exploitation attempts. WordPress hosts have also been privately told of the flaw, and they quietly moved to protect their users. \u201cBy Wednesday afternoon, most of the hosts we worked with had protections in place. Data from all four WAFs [this includes Sucuri\u2019s] and WordPress hosts showed no indication that the vulnerability had been exploited in the wild,\u201d the WP security team disclosed on Wednesday. \u201cAs a result, we made the decision to delay disclosure of this particular issue to give time for automatic updates to run and ensure as many users as possible were protected before the issue was made public\u201d. Within a couple of hours of the release of the update, WordPress users who have opted for the automatic WP update option had the WP 4.7.2 installed and were protected.

There are rumors, emanating from a Western intelligence agency, that the notorious Russian hacking group APT28 is\u00a0behind the attack. There would certainly seem to be speculative evidence for this assumption, given that OSCE currently has 700 monitors overseeing the conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine. The conflict has been at the center of numerous cyber espionage campaigns tracked back to the Kremlin, most recently one aimed at tracking Ukrainian troop movements via the RAT Sofacy (X-Agent). That particular campaign was also tied back to APT28 (aka Fancy Bear/Sofacy/Pawn Storm). More infamously, the group has been linked to a hacking campaign against Democratic Party members which resulted in the publication of private emails designed to destabilize the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and undermine the US democratic process. Last week, President Obama decided to expel 35 suspected Russian spies and place sanctions on the GRU, which is thought to be linked to APT28, as well as another Russian intelligence service: the FSB.

According to US-CERT, the vulnerability could also be exploited to execute arbitrary code with Windows kernel privileges on vulnerable systems, but this has not been confirmed right now by Microsoft. Without revealing the actual scope of the vulnerability and the kind of threat the exploit poses, Microsoft has just downplayed the severity of the issue, saying: \"Windows is the only platform with a customer commitment to investigate reported security issues, and proactively update impacted devices as soon as possible. We recommend customers use Windows 10 and the Microsoft Edge browser for the best protection.\" However, the proof-of-concept exploit code, Win10.py, has already been released publicly for Windows 10 by security researcher Laurent Gaffie and does not require targets to use a browser. The memory corruption flaw resides in the manner in which Windows handles SMB traffic that could be exploited by attackers; all they need is tricking victims to connect to a malicious SMB server, which could be easily done using clever social engineering tricks. \"In particular, Windows fails to properly handle a server response that contains too many bytes following the structure defined in the SMB2 TREE_CONNECT Response structure,\" CERT said in the advisory. \"By connecting to a malicious SMB server, a vulnerable Windows client system may crash (BSOD) in mrxsmb20.sys.\" Since the exploit code is now publicly available to everyone and there is no official patch from Microsoft, all Windows users are left open to potential attacks at this time. Until Microsoft patches the memory corruption flaw (most probably in the upcoming Windows update or out-of-band patch), Windows users can temporarily fix the issue by blocking outbound SMB connections (TCP ports 139 and 445 and UDP ports 137 and 138) from the local network to the WAN.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: resides in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: been confirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: has just downplayed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: released, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: resides in, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patches, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: temporarily fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The vulnerable systems could allow hackers or foreign actors to launch cyberattacks through the department's systems to make it look as though it originated from US networks. Dan Tentler, founder of cybersecurity firm Phobos Group, who discovered the vulnerable hosts, warned the flaws are so easy to find that he believes he was probably not the first person to find them. \"It's very likely that these servers are being exploited in the wild,\" he told me on the phone. While the Pentagon is said to be aware of the vulnerable servers, it has yet to implement any fixes -- more than eight months after the department was alerted. It's a unique case that casts doubts on the effectiveness of the Trump administration's anticipated executive order on cybersecurity, which aims to review all federal systems of security issues and vulnerabilities over a 60-day period. The draft order was leaked last week, but it was abruptly pulled minutes before it was expected to be signed on Tuesday. Tentler, a critic of the plans, argued that the draft plans are \"just not feasible.\" \"It's laughable that an order like this was drafted in the first place because it demonstrates a complete lack of understanding what the existing problems are,\" he said. \"The order will effectively demand a vulnerability assessment on the entire government, and they want it in 60 days? It's been months -- and they still haven't fixed it,\" he said. In the past year, the Pentagon became the first government department to ease up on computer hacking laws by allowing researchers to find and report bugs and flaws in systems in exchange for financial rewards. Trump aides' use of encrypted messaging may violate records law Using disappearing messages in government could be a \"recipe for corruption,\" says one expert. Researchers must limit their testing to two domains -- \"defense.gov\" (and its subdomains) and any \".mil\" subdomain. In an effort to pare down the list of hosts from \"all public Department of Defense hosts\" to \"only the ones in scope,\" Tentler was able to identify several hosts that answered to the domain names in scope.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: warned, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: warned, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are so easy to find, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: find, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: is said to be aware, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: implement any fixes, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: was alerted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The IRS also informed employers the W-2 scam has moved beyond corporations, expanding to include schools, tribal organizations, and nonprofits. In a statement, IRS Commissioner, John Koskinen, said the scams - sometimes known as Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks - are some of the most dangerous email scams the agency has seen in a long time. [ Learn about top security certifications: Who they're for, what they cost, and which you need. \"It can result in the large-scale theft of sensitive data that criminals can use to commit various crimes, including filing fraudulent tax returns. We need everyone\u2019s help to turn the tide against this scheme,\" Koskinen said. In 2016, at least 145 organizations fell victim to BEC scams, exposing tens of thousands of employees to tax fraud and identity theft. Salted Hash kept track of some of the high-profile cases, and Databreaches.net tracked everything, resulting in a massive list of documented successful attacks. As of February 5, 23 organizations have disclosed BEC-related data breaches publicly, each one resulting in compromised W-2 data. The confirmed BEC victims include ten school systems, a software development firm, a utility company in Pennsylvania, at least one restaurant in Indianapolis, and businesses operating within the healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and energy sectors. Distribution International emailed employees that their W-2 data was compromised on January 27. Their notification expands the number of affected taxpayers to more than 30,000. The scammers spoofed an email and pretended to be one of the company's owners. W-2 records for all companies and all employees were compromised. Salted Hash reached out to Sky Climber's CFO, Jeff Caswell, for more information. Also, the College of Southern Idaho has reported an incident that could impact 3,000 employees. According to Public Information Officer Doug Maughan, the W-2 records affected belong to seasonal and auxiliary staff.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: theft of sensitive data, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: BEC scams, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: BEC-related data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: spoofed, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: pretended to be, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: were compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The school didn't say the incident was the result of a BEC attack, but Salted Hash is listing it anyway due to the timing of the attack and the information targeted. Finally today, the West Michigan Whitecaps - a Class A minor league baseball team affiliated with the Detroit Tigers - said staff W-2 records were compromised after someone posing as a manager requested them. In 2016, the criminals behind the BEC attacks mostly focused on payroll and tax records. This year though, the IRS says that in addition to the usual records request, the scammers are now following-up and requesting wire transfers. \"Although not tax related, the wire transfer scam is being coupled with the W-2 scam email, and some companies have lost both employees\u2019 W-2s and thousands of dollars due to wire transfers,\" the IRS explained in their warning. \"Employers should consider creating an internal policy, if one is lacking, on the distribution of employee W-2 information and conducting wire transfers.\" BEC attacks are essentially Phishing scams, or Spear Phishing since the criminals have a specific target. They're effective too, exploiting the trust relationships that exist within the corporate environment. In a majority of the reported cases from 2016, the attackers forged an email and pretended to be the victim organization's top executive, or someone with direct authority.

They have become common tools for cyber criminals trying to cripple businesses and organizations with significant online activities. \u201cWe have never seen this on such a scale - five companies hit at one time with the same threat,\u201d said Wang, adding that the regulator usually sees single instances of cyber-crime. FireEye, a cybersecurity consultancy, said the attacks were similar to a wave of threatened denial of service attacks by a previously unidentified group that first appeared in Europe last month. The Taiwan attacks do not pose a threat to the island\u2019s broader trading and financial system, Wang said, but he added that the regulator had asked all securities firms to step up defensive measures. \u201cThe emails were sent under the name of the \u2018Armada Collective\u2019,\u201d said Chiu Shao-chou, an official of the internet cybercrime division of Taiwan\u2019s Criminal Investigation Bureau, the government\u2019s top investigation body. The Armada Collective, a hacking extortion group, has been linked to financial blackmail heists elsewhere. But Chiu said the group has been put under watch and Taiwan investigators were still looking into the original source of the emails. The email demanded payment in web-based digital currency bitcoin equivalent to about T$300,000 ($9,731.41), Taiwan media said. None of the securities companies made any payments, Chiu said.

The news site said that during the past week, the security teams at several, yet unnamed, Polish banks detected downloads of suspicious files and encrypted traffic going to uncommon IPs situated in many foreign countries. As employees at different banks started looking into their systems, they found malware installed on numerous workstations and even some servers. The JavaScript code worked by opening a hidden iframe and forcibly downloading a file on the victim's computers. Users that discovered and executed this file would install a remote access trojan (RAT) on their computers. According to Zaufana Trzecia Strona, this malware has a zero detection rate on VirusTotal and appears to be a new malware strain, never-before-seen in live attacks. KNF's staff have cleaned their site and along with the affected banks, have reported the incidents to CERT.pl. The affected Polish banks said the malware that infected their computers and servers encrypted its outgoing traffic and they weren't able to tell what the attackers stole. Banks reassured their clients and said they haven't detected any unauthorized transactions, but only the mysterious outgoing traffic. Local media believes the attack is the work of a foreign intelligence agency. A more believable theory would be that this is the work of one of the many cyber-crime syndicates specialized in cyber-thefts from financial institutions. The attacks have the signs of classic network reconnaissance operations, where hackers gather intelligence in order to create a map of a victim's network before launching their final assaults[/INST]\n\nTrigger: stole, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: cyber-thefts, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Cybercriminals often share infrastructure between one another, so the fact that Locky and Sage use the same recourses is not that surprising. However, the fact also shows that the crooks behind Locky are working on securing new distribution venues after the main Locky distributor \u2013 Necurs botnet \u2013 recently went silent. The Sage ransomware first appeared on the malware stage at the end of last year and was analyzed early this year. The first distribution email messages relied on racy or explicit narratives to fool victims into opening the malicious attachments. Later, the operators abandoned this tactic and starting using business-related themes and random numbers in the subjects to avoid spam filters. Some of the delivery emails didn\u2019t come with a subject at all but they did use the victim`s name in the file attachment name. This file attachment was usually a double-zipper archive that contained a malicious .js file or an Office document. Other messages posed as a rejected financial transaction, failed deposit/refund or canceled order alerts in order to trick the users into opening them. The campaign, according to PhishMe, used a .zip file (named \u201cdocument_1.zip\u201d), containing a JavaScript application in it, which would download the Sage ransomware in the form of a Windows executable. The payload was retrieved from the domain affections[. ]top, and the malware relied on the same payment gateway\u2019s Tor site as before, as well as the Tor2Web gateway addresses on rzunt3u2[. Then, however, on January 26th, another phishing campaign was spotted to distribute the Locky ransomware, leveraging the same email messages and metadata. ]top was used as a part of the distribution for this infection on January 30th. \u201cThis connection pushes the narrative forward in yet another way as the Locky distribution in question was yet another example of that ransomware being paired with the Kovter Trojan\u201d. The connection between Kovter and Locky has been already analyzed a couple of times. Most recently, Microsoft discovered a two-step delivery technique which intended to drip Locky first, but if that failed, it switched to dropping the Kovter Trojan.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: fool, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: posed as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: trick, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

TLS is used to secure an app\u2019s communication over an internet connection. Without it, a hacker can essentially eavesdrop over a network to spy on whatever data the app sends, such as login information. \u201cThis sort of attack can be conducted by any party within Wi-Fi range of your device while it is in use,\u201d Strafach said. \u201cThis can be anywhere in public, or even within your home if an attacker can get within close range\u201d. Strafach discovered the vulnerability in the 76 apps by scanning them with his company-developed security service, verify.ly, which he's promoting. It flagged \u201chundreds of applications\u201d with a high likelihood of data interception. He\u2019s so far confirmed that these 76 apps possess the vulnerability. He did so by running them on an iPhone running iOS 10 and using a proxy to insert an invalid TLS certificate into the connection. Strafach declared that 43 of the apps were either a high or medium risk, because they risked exposing login information and authentication tokens. Some of them are from \u201cbanks, medical providers, and other developers of sensitive applications,\u201d he said. He's not disclosing their names, to give them time to patch the problem. The remaining 33 apps were deemed low risks because they revealed only partially sensitive data, such as email addresses. They include the free messaging service ooVoo, video uploaders to Snapchat and lesser-known music streaming services, among many others. In all, the 76 apps have 18 million downloads, according to app market tracker Apptopia, Strafach said. It\u2019ll be up to the app developers to fix the problem, but it only involves changing a few lines of code, says Strafach, who\u2019s been trying to contact the developers. He included some warnings for developers in the blog post. \u201cBe extremely careful when inserting network-related code and changing application behaviors,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMany issues like this arise from an application developer not fully understanding the code they\u2019ve borrowed from the web\u201d.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: confirmed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: declared, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: disclosing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: to patch, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: to fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Honeywell published in September new firmware that patches vulnerabilities privately disclosed by researcher Maxim Rupp in its XL Web II controllers. The flaws could give an attacker the ability to access relatively unprotected credentials and use those to manipulate, for example, environmental controls inside a building. While these aren\u2019t critical infrastructure systems such as wastewater, energy or manufacturing, building automation system hacks can be expensive to remedy, and in a worst-case scenario, afford an attacker the ability to pivot to a corporate network. Experts told Threatpost that building automation systems can be used to remotely manage heating, air conditioning, water, lighting and door security, and help reduce building operations costs. They\u2019re also popping up as more and more buildings go green; such systems, for example, are crucial to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification from the United States Green Building Council. \u201cThe main risk from this is a super simple method of accessing building system HMIs, whether for mischief or maybe even ransom. Controllers like this provide an easy interface to operating the entire building system, no additional programming knowledge or protocol expertise required,\u201d said Michael Toecker of Context Information Security. Unless very poorly designed, a user can\u2019t damage equipment from the HMI, but they can make the building inhospitable, inefficient, and expensive to fix\u201d. The Industrial Control System Cyber Emergency Response Team (ICS-CERT) issued an advisory last Thursday warning of five vulnerabilities in the Honeywell XL1000C500 XLWebExe-2-01-00 and prior, and XLWeb 500 XLWebExe-1-02-08 and prior. Four of the five are authentication-related flaws, the most serious of which involved passwords either stored in clear text or reachable by accessing a particular URL. A user with low privileges could also open and change parameters via a URL, ICS-CERT said. Honeywell also patched a session fixation vulnerability allowing an attacker to establish new users sessions without invalidating prior sessions, giving them access to authenticated sessions. It also patched a path traversal bug that allowed attackers to carry out directory traversal attacks via a URL.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patches, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: privately disclosed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: issued, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: warning, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are authentication-related, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

The hosting service, Freedom Hosting II, was known for operating thousands of sites that were accessible through the Tor browser; the \"dark web\" is essentially the encrypted network comprising Tor servers and browsers. Its main landing page was replaced with a\u00a0message saying that it had been hacked. Allegedly, Freedom Hosting II had been hosting child pornography sites, though its anonymous operator claimed to have a zero-tolerance policy toward such content, according to the hacker behind the breach. \u201cWhat we found while searching through your server is more than 50% child porn\u2026\u201d the hacker wrote in the message left on the site. \u201cMoreover, you host many scam sites, some of which are evidently run by yourself to cover hosting expenses\u201d. In an email to the IDG News Service, the hacker explained how the breach came about. \u201cI just recently read an article about a well-known exploit that some hosting providers fell victims of many years ago,\u201d the person said. However, starting on Jan. 30, the hacker gained access to its web server, using a 20-step method. The hack essentially involved starting a new site on Freedom Hosting II and creating a link to gain access to the service\u2019s root directory. This allowed the hacker to browse the entire server. \u201cI had reading permissions to everything the web server could get access to just by creating a symlink to / (the root directory)\u201d.

The security vendor revealed the findings in its Q4 2016 Threat Summary and Year in Review report. It claimed fraudulent accounts across sites like Twitter and Facebook increased 100% from the third to fourth quarter. Such accounts are used for phishing, malware distribution, spam and other ends. In fact, Proofpoint observed a 20% increase in Facebook and Twitter spam from Q3 to Q4, with the quarter recording the second highest spam volume in the year. Yet it was a particular variety of phishing that caught the eye. So-called \u201cangler phishing\u201d is a relatively new tactic in which the black hats register fake Twitter accounts that masquerade as customer support accounts. They monitor the real support accounts for irate customer messages and then quickly jump in to send messages back to those users loaded with malicious links. The tactic was particularly common among financial services and entertainment accounts, according to the report. Elsewhere, the number of new ransomware variants grew 30-fold over Q4, and malicious email campaigns grew significantly, with Q4's largest campaign 6.7 times the size of Q3's. Some of the biggest campaigns apparently involved hundreds of millions of messages dropping Locky ransomware. However, there was some good news, with scams involving the spoofing of CEO emails sent to CFOs falling 28% in the final quarter. This is partly because CFOs are more cautious about the veracity of such messages, but can also be linked to a 33% surge in DMARC implementation which helped to block attempts to spoof the CEO\u2019s email address. In addition, exploit kits remained at low levels of activity after some high profile Angler EK arrests in Q2, although large scale malvertising campaigns persisted, Proofpoint claimed.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: posing as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: claimed, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: angler phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: masquerade as, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: sent to, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: spoof, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

The big difference was that instead of targeting financial services companies, phishers increasingly targeted cloud storage service providers like Google and DropBox, security vendor PhishLabs said in a voluminous report on phishing trends released this week. Compared to 2013, when barely 10% of phishing attacks targeted cloud storage services, about 22.5% of phishing attacks last year involved such companies. That was just barely below the 23% of phishing scams involving financial brands, the company noted. What that means is that users are likely going to get more phishing emails this year trying to get them to part with credentials to their cloud storage credentials. \"Over the last four years, the number of phishing attacks targeting cloud storage services has skyrocketed,\" says Crane Hassold, senior security threat researcher at PhishLabs. \"Based on recent trends, it is likely that phishing attacks targeting cloud storage services will overtake financial institutions as the top target for phishers in 2017.\" So far at least, almost all phishing attacks impacting this industry have involved only Google and DropBox. Many of the phishing campaigns targeting cloud storage providers contain lures saying that a document or picture has been shared with the victim and encourage them to sign in to their account in order to view it. A majority of the phishing pages involved in such campaigns have really been poor duplicates of the pages used by Google, DropBox, and other legitimate sites. Even so, \"based on the growing popularity of these types of attacks, phishers must still be having success compromising victim even with this lack of authenticity,\" Hassold says. The PhishLabs report is based on an analysis of some one million confirmed phishing sites spread across more than 170,000 unique domains, and also from the company\u2019s handling of more than 7,800 phishing attacks per month in 2016. The analysis showed an alarming increase across the board in phishing-related activities.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing scams, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: the phishing campaigns, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lures, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: campaigns, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing-related activities, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

PhishLabs identified a total of 976 brands belonging to 568 organizations that cybercriminal used in phishing campaigns last year. The kind of data that phishers went after also broadened considerably last year. In addition to account credentials and personal data, phishers also used their phishing lures to try and snag financial, employment, and account security data like answers to challenge/response questions and mother\u2019s maiden name. Ransomware's Best Friend In 2016, phishing also continued to be by far the most prevalent method for delivering ransomware on everything from end user systems to systems belonging to businesses, government agencies, schools, and critical infrastructure targets. The use of email as an authentication measure made it easier for phishers to mass harvest credentials for all email services on a single phishing site, instead of having to target email providers individually,\u00a0Hassold says. \"Additionally, because a growing number of Web services are using email as a primary credential, phishers are able to multiply their profits by conducting password reuse attacks against these unsuspecting targets,\" he says. The easy availability of phish kits, or ready-to-use templates for creating working phishing sites, contributed to the problem. Many of these kits included sophisticated anti-detection mechanisms. Mechanisms included access control measures based on IP address, HTTP referrer, and hostname, whitelists, and blocklists. \"The big takeaway is that we\u2019ve created ideal conditions for the mass harvesting of credentials via phishing attacks,\" Hassold notes. Unlike in the past where phishers were focused on immediate gains\u2014by going after and selling access to financial accounts for instance\u2014they are now trying to maximize the information they can compromise with the least effort.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing campaigns, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing lures, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: harvest, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: harvesting, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: phishing attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

A group of researchers from United States universities as well as tech companies Google, Mozilla, and Cloudflare tested middleboxes - which act\u00a0as network proxies for traffic analysis and content filtering - from A10, Blue Coat, Barracuda, CheckPoint, Cisco, Fortinet, Juniper, Microsoft, Sophos, Untangle, and WebTitan. All but the BlueCoat device weakened connection security and introduced TLS vulnerabilities such as Logjam, weak export and RC4 ciphers, or didn't validate digital certificates properly. The researchers also tested [pdf] 29 anti-viruses, and found 13 would intercept TLS connections. Only Avast versions 10 and 11 for Windows did not reduce TLS connection security. Interception of TLS connections involves security products injecting their own certificates in web browsers or devices in organisation networks. This alllows them to terminate TLS connections, decrypt the traffic so as to look for malicious or disallowed content, and then re-initiate the TLS connection after analysis is complete. Such interception is increasingly prevalent, the researchers said, meaning the security community is working at cross purposes - the attempts to detect and block harmful traffic dramatically reduces connection security, the researchers said. \"Many of the vulnerabilities we find in anti-virus products and corporate middleboxes \u2014 such as failing to validate certificates and advertising broken ciphers \u2014 are negligent and another data point in a worrying trend of security products worsening security rather than improving it,\" they wrote. Compounding the problem, the researchers noted that while it was possible to adjust middlebox settings in many cases to avoid them degrading TLS security, their configuration was \"confusing, oftentimes with little or no documentation\". \"We note that the installation process for many of these proxies is convoluted, crash-prone, and at times, non-deterministic,\" they said. Testing middleboxes with services such as Qualys SSL Labs, How's My SSL, and Bad SSL is a must for administrators, the researchers said. There is no good reason for anti-virus vendors to intercept TLS since their software operates locally and already has access to the file system, browser memory, and any content loaded over HTTPS, they claimed.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: introduced, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: find, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Hacked emails that are apparently reputation-shredding \u2013 plus enough media attention paid to the details of the leaked content to overshadow the actual crime. The Daily Mail reports that police in Portugal have launched an investigation into an attack on the servers at Beckham\u2019s PR firm, Doyen Global, which is run by his friend Simon Oliveira. The police have reportedly been investigating the attack for the past 12 months. According to the Telegraph, the hackers had allegedly demanded \u20ac1m ($1.07m) \u00a0in exchange for destroying a dossier of some 18.6m emails and documents, which the ever-colorful British press have dubbed \u201cBeckileaks\u201d. A source told the Telegraph that the blackmailer(s) first made the pitch by email, using the fake name of Artem Lovuzov. \u201cLovuzov\u201d allegedly told Doyen Sports chief executive Neilo Lucas that paying the money would ensure that no embarrassing messages were given to the press: A generous donation, and you can be sure that all the information I possess will be destroyed. The Beckham team didn\u2019t respond, so the blackmailer set a deadline: I\u2019m giving you until 16.00 on Tuesday to contact my lawyer with a view to a proper resolution to this impasse.

Virtually all of the malware resided solely in the memory of the compromised computers, a feat that had allowed the infection to remain undetected for six months or more. Kaspersky eventually unearthed evidence that Duqu 2.0, as the never-before-seen malware was dubbed, was derived from Stuxnet, the highly sophisticated computer worm reportedly created by the US and Israel to sabotage Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The Kaspersky Lab researchers still don't know if a single group of individuals is behind the attacks, or if they're being carried out by competing hacker gangs. The use of the fileless malware and command-server domains that aren't associated with any whois data makes the already difficult task of attribution almost impossible. The researchers first discovered the malware late last year, when a bank's security team found a copy of Meterpreter\u2014an in-memory component of Metasploit\u2014residing inside the physical memory of a Microsoft domain controller. After conducting a forensic analysis, the researchers found that the Meterpreter code was downloaded and injected into memory using PowerShell commands. The infected machine also used Microsoft's NETSH networking tool to transport data to attacker-controlled servers. To obtain the administrative privileges necessary to do these things, the attackers also relied on Mimikatz. To reduce the evidence left in logs or hard drives, the attackers stashed the PowerShell commands into the Windows registry. Fortunately, the evidence on the domain controller was intact, presumably because it hadn't been restarted before Kaspersky Lab researchers began their investigation. An analysis of the dumped memory contents and the Windows registries allowed the researchers to restore the Meterpreter and Mimikatz code. The attackers, the researchers later determined, had used the tools to collect passwords of system administrators and for the remote administration of infected host machines.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: collect, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Named \"MacDownloader\" and posing as, what else, a fake Flash Player update, the new malware\u00a0was found on the Mac of a human rights advocate and believed to originate from Iran. The malware's code is very sloppy and appears to have been made by an amateur who\u00a0took pieces of other's code and repurposed them. The threat report mentions the following: MacDownloader seems to be poorly developed and created towards the end of 2016, potentially a first attempt from an amateur developer. In multiple cases, the code used has been copied from elsewhere. The simple activity of downloading the remote file appears to have been sourced from a cheat sheet. The main purpose of MacDownloader seems to be to perform an initial profiling of the infected system and collection of credentials from macOS\u2019s Keychain password manager \u2013 which mirrors the focus of Windows malware developed by the same actors. At this time, it appears the malware is not a threat and the Command & Control server has been taken down. Intego VirusBarrier offers protection from this malware, detected as OSX/MacDownloader. Security researchers found that this malware was originally designed as a fake Bitdefender antivirus, but was later repackaged as a fake Flash Player update. Once installed, the\u00a0malware attempts to achieve persistence by use of a poorly implemented shell script, which at the time of writing did not function due to the C&C server being offline.

Addresses, names and phone numbers for staff were accessed in the data breach SPORTS\u00a0Direct failed to tell its workers about a major data breach that saw personal information accessed by hackers. A\u00a0cyber attacker gained access to internal systems containing details for\u00a0phone numbers, names and home and email addresses of\u00a0the retail giant's\u00a030,000 staff members. But according to The Register, workers still haven't been told about the breach, which took place in September. Sports Direct discovered the attack three months later after a phone number was left on the company's internal site with a message encouraging bosses to make contact. Chiefs filed a report with the Information Commissioner's office after it became aware that personal information had been compromised. But as there was no evidence the data had been shared, Sports Direct didn't report the breach to staff. The blunder is the latest in a string of controversies surrounding the sporting goods retailer. Allegations also surfaced of some workers being promised permanent contracts in exchange for sexual favours. Committee chairman Iain Wright said evidence heard by MPs last year suggested Sports Direct's working practices \"are closer to that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern, reputable High Street retailer\". In November, six MPs from the Business and Skills Committee said attempts were made to record their private discussions when they visited Sport Direct to investigate working practices.

The issue affects servers that use both the DNS64 and RPZ function simultaneously. DNS64 is a mechanism for synthesizing AAAA records from A records. It\u2019s traditionally used to allow IPv6-only clients to receive IPv6 addresses proxied to IPv4 addresses. The RPZ mechanism is used by Domain Name System recursive resolvers to allow for the customized handling of the resolution of collections of domain name information. Versions 9.8.8, 9.9.3-S1, 9.9.3, 9.9.10b1, 9.10.0, and 9.10.5b1, 9.11.0 are all considered vulnerable, according to the ISC. When servers use both mechanisms simultaneously, a vulnerability (CVE-2017-3135) that stems\u00a0from query processing could result in an inconsistent state, triggering either an INSIST assertion failure or an attempt to read through a NULL pointer, according to a security advisory published Wednesday. The INSIST assertion failure could lead to a subsequent abort, ISC said, while the NULL pointer in some instances can lead to a segmentation fault, which causes the process to be terminated. Ramesh Damodaran and Aliaksandr Shubnik, engineers at Infoblox, a Silicon Valley firm that does\u00a0DNS, DHCP and IP management, uncovered the vulnerability and reported it to the ISC. Damodaran previously helped identified an unspecified packet processing remote denial of service vulnerability in BIND 9. The Internet Systems Consortium patched the BIND domain name system this week, addressing what it calls a critical error condition in the software. Researchers find industrial control system malware similar to BlackEnergy, Havex, and Stuxnet going undetected on Google VirusTotal for years.

David Formby, a PhD student at Georgia Institute of Technology, conducted his experiment to warn the industry about the danger of poorly-secured PLCs. These small dedicated computers can be used to control important factory processes or utilities, but are sometimes connected to the internet. For instance, Formby found that 1,500 of these industrial PLCs are accessible online, he said while speaking at the RSA cybersecurity conference on Monday. It's not hard to imagine a hacker trying to exploit these exposed PLCs, he added. Cybercriminals have been infecting businesses across the world with ransomware, a form of malware that can hold data hostage in exchange for bitcoin. For a hacker, holding an industrial control system hostage can also be lucrative, and far more devastating for the victim. \u201cHe (the hacker) can threaten to permanently damage this really sensitive equipment,\u201d Formby said. In a month's time he developed a ransomware-like attack to control the PLCs to fill the storage tank with too much chlorine, making the water mix dangerous to drink. Formby also managed to fool the surrounding sensors into thinking that clean water was actually inside the tank. A hacker wanting to blackmail a water utility could take a same approach, and threaten to taint the water supply unless paid a ransom, he warned. Real-world water treatment systems are more sophisticated than the generic one he designed, Formby said. However, poorly-secured PLCs are being used across every industry, including in oil and gas plants and manufacturing. Most of these PLCs he found that were accessible online are located in the U.S., but many others were found in India and China, he said. Formby recommends that industrial operators make sure they understand which systems connect to the internet, and who has control over them. He\u2019s also set up a company designed to help operators monitor for any malicious activity over their industrial control systems.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: hold data hostage, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: holding an industrial control system hostage, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: blackmail, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paid a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Initial targets of ransomware-wielding criminals were mostly individual users. Not long after, the crooks discovered that they could get greater sums from businesses and organizations whose critical data and systems they managed to encrypt and/or make unusable. So they began hitting hospitals and other healthcare institutions, universities and schools, police departments and transportation systems, and businesses of every kind. Such a lucrative business model is not going to be abandoned soon, and we are sure to witness its evolution. A group of researchers from Georgia Tech School of Electrical and Computer Engineering showed that it\u2019s possible to craft ransomware aimed at compromising and fiddling with industrial control systems. The team demonstrated their own proof-of-concept ransomware targeting programmable logic controllers (PLCs) at RSA Conference 2017 on Monday, showing how a hacker might disrupt the regular functioning of a water treatment plant. They started their research into this attack possibility by identifying severs common PLCs in use at industrial facilities, then obtained three different devices for testing. They probed them for security issues such as weak authentication mechanisms and susceptibility to settings changes, and finally combined them with pumps, tubes and tanks to create a simulated water treatment facility. But \u201crecent attacks on hospitals have demonstrated how profitable ransomware can be when used to hold operationally critical assets hostage with the threat of human harm, and reports suggest attackers are beginning to shift their focus on ICS networks\u201d. I would imagine that the ransom demanded in these cases could be higher than anything seen so far, as the damages to the physical systems could be extensive and the potential for human harm is great. On the other hand, the risk for the attackers is also higher, as government agencies would surely get involved in tracking them down[/INST]\n\nTrigger: recent attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the ransom demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

While that's a scary scenario, it fortunately \u00a0hasn't happened\u2014yet. But a group of researchers from the Georgia Institute of Technology warn that could change very soon, and to prove it they have developed and tested in their lab a working proof of concept ransomware that specifically targets three types of PLCs. In their scenario, a group of cybercriminals targets PLCs that are exposed online and infects them with custom malware designed to reprogram the tiny computer with a new password, locking out the legitimate owners. The hackers then alert the owner, asking for a ransom. \"Ransomware\" is a specific type of malicious software that infects computers and locks or encrypts their content, demanding a ransom to return the machines \u00a0to their original state. It's been extremely popular in the last couple of years, and is often successful because it's usually easier for victims to pay the ransom than try to decrypt the files on their own. Initially, ransomware targeted regular internet users indiscriminately, but there have already been cases of attacks against hospitals, hotels and other businesses. (And there will soon be attacks on Internet of Things too)  Thus, the researchers argue, it's inevitable that criminals will soon target critical infrastructure directly. Beyah and his colleagues David Formby and Srikar Durbha searched the internet for the two models of PLCs that they attacked in the lab and found more 1,500 that were exposed online. With their research, Beyah said, the three hope that industrial control systems administrators will start adopting common security practices such as changing the PLCs default passwords, putting them behind a firewall, and scanning the networks for potential intruders. If they don't, they might find their systems locked, and the consequence could spill into the physical world.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: demand a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: asking for a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

First spotted on Dec. 27 by Victor Gevers, an ethical hacker and founder of GDI Foundation, attacks in the past two months shot up from 200 to near 50,000. The first of these\u00a0ransom attacks against insecure databases traces back to a hacker identified as Harak1r1, who Gevers said was responsible for compromising open MongoDB installations, deleting their contents, and leaving behind a ransom note demanding 0.2 BTC (about $220 at the time). After that, escalation of attacks against open MongoDB installations\u00a0happened fast, jumping from hundreds one week, to 2,000 the next, and 10,000 the following week. At last count more than\u00a056,000 open MongoDB databases alone are ripe for attack, according to the most recent numbers available from GDI Foundation. But that doesn\u2019t include a slew of new databases now being targeted by cybercriminals. Security researchers at Rapid7 estimate that 50 percent of the 56,000 vulnerable MongoDB servers have been ransomed. In a typical ransomware attack, an attacker compromises a computer via malware or Trojan and encrypts local data that can only be unlocked with an encryption key obtained for a price. That spurred a maturing of ransomware used against more sophisticated healthcare, government and educational targets with similar phishing, malware and Trojan techniques. However, experts say, both have acted as the stepping stones to this type of data hijacking. With data hijacking, attackers compromise insecure database installations, copy data, then delete the contents and leaving behind a ransom note in the form of a directory name demanding a ransom be paid via Bitcoin. Rapid7 has already seen additional databases such as Redis, Kibana and other SQL databases targeted in its honeypots. Josh Gomez, senior security researcher with security firm Anomali, said moving forward attacks will be less random, more targeted and seek high-value repositories with weak protection.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: online extortion, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: these\u00a0ransom attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: have been ransomed, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: phishing, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: demanding a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: be paid, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The Android Trojan can mimic the user's clicks and actions. A new form of Trojan malware targeting Android smartphones is duping victims into downloading a fake security update for Adobe Flash Player, which then makes them even more susceptible to malicious software. The malware is ultimately designed to monitor the users' activity for the purposes of stealing data, mimicking their actions in order to generate funds from fraudulent adware installations, and enabling the installation of various other types of malware --  including ransomware. Detected by researchers at security company ESET, the Trojan malware targets all versions of Google's mobile operating system and aims to trick victims into granting it special permissions which it uses to download additional malware. Users should also be wary of apps which appear to ask for many more permissions then they might need. For those who've already fallen victim to this malware, they can attempt to remove the malware by manually uninstalling the 'Flash-Player' app from their phone.

That vendor told the pediatric facility that it had seen online documents threatening the hospital, as well as posted documents with information on physicians such as cell phone numbers, addresses and work locations. And the information also included details of Boston Children\u2019s infrastructure, such as the main IP address of its organizational web site. Any kid could find this stuff easily online, but it was clear someone was trying to damage the reputation of Boston Children\u2019s, said Daniel Nigrin, MD, senior vice president and CIO in the division of endocrinology, during the Cybersecurity Forum at HIMSS17. Then came a video from the activist hacking organization Anonymous, accusing the hospital of having tortured a child. \u201cI\u2019ve been a CISO for 16 years; this was a new one me,\u201d Nigrin recalled. In particular, the charge from Anonymous centered on a teenage girl that the hospital determined was suffering from malnutrition. The case went to court, where a judge\u2019s ruling removed the child from parental custody. The family fought the decision, and the controversy found its way to Anonymous, which decided that Boston Children\u2019s needed to be taught a lesson. \u201cWe wondered if it was the real Anonymous; thankfully, the decision was to take the threat seriously,\u201d Nigrin said. The hospital convened an incident response team and starting forming contingency plans for an expected attack, which included \u201cgoing dark\u201d and cutting itself off from the Internet while assessing the systems and processes still necessary to keep the facility running. In the meantime, Boston Children\u2019s contacted local police and the FBI, who were reluctant to step in proactively, and told hospital executives to get back to them if anything happened. Three weeks went by without incident, and the facility was hit with low-value distributed denial of service attacks that were handled.

The target list includes editors of Ukrainian newspapers, a scientific research institute; a company that designs remote monitoring systems for oil & gas pipeline infrastructures; an international organization that monitors human rights, counter-terrorism and cyberattacks on critical infrastructure in Ukraine; and an engineering company that designs electrical substations, gas distribution pipelines, and water supply plants; among many others. According to CyberX security experts, attacks are mostly driven by spear-phishing emails that spread Word documents that contain malicious macros. Attacks lure victims into allowing the macros in these documents to execute by telling them the document was created in a newer version of Word, and enabling macros allows them to view their content. Enabling macros downloads several malware families in multiple stages. The downloaded malware doesn't include destructive features and uses several mechanisms to remain hidden, an important clue pointing to the fact its authors are using it for reconnaissance only. Using Dropbox instead of a custom web server for collecting data is yet another sign that hackers are trying to stay hidden as long as possible. This is because it would be much easier to detect malicious traffic sent to a remote web server compared to Dropbox, an application whitelisted by firewalls and other security products. CyberX researchers named this particular campaign BugDrop because crooks used the PC's microphone's to bug victims, and Dropbox to exfiltrate data. After they analyzed the malware deployed in this campaign, CyberX security experts claim the malware and techniques used in the BugDrop operation are similar to Groundbait, another cyber-espionage campaign discovered in May 2016 by ESET researchers.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: Attacks, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: collecting data, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exfiltrate, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Because the actors in this case are relying on paid, targeted ads on Twitter, users don\u2019t need to do anything to see the phishing link. Attackers are increasing the sophistication of social engineering approaches and extending them across social channels. Users and brands need to be increasingly savvy to avoid getting snared by ads, accounts, and messages that initially look legitimate. While this attack was observed on Twitter, such a scam could be implemented on any social media platform that implements some form of account verification. The full blog post can be found here, however key takeouts include: \u201cVerified accounts\u201d are a powerful tool on Twitter to help brands differentiate themselves from fraudulent, impersonation, and parody accounts on the social media site. When an account is officially verified, it displays a special badge intended to reassure Twitter users that they are interacting with a genuine brand and not an impostor. Recently, however, threat actors are using the promise of verified accounts to lure users into a credit card phishing scheme. Account verification is a process that Twitter manages for \u201caccounts of public interest\u201d and requires brands to go through multiple verification steps. The promise, then, of a quick verification process is attractive, especially to smaller businesses that potentially lack the resources to meet\u00a0Twitter\u2019s requirements\u00a0for account verification. In this phishing attack, discovered by Proofpoint researchers in December, attackers place legitimate ads targeting brand managers and influencers with a link to a phishing site purporting to offer account verification. The ads themselves come from an account that mimics the official Twitter support account, @support. The fraudulent account, @SupportForAll6, uses Twitter branding, logos, colors, etc., to increase the sense of authenticity, despite a very low number of followers and a suspect name[/INST]\n\nTrigger: phishing campaign, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: lure, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing scheme, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: phishing attack, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: purporting, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: come from, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: mimics, Event Type: Attack:Phishing</s>"}

Sources recently pointed out to us that many pages on the site, which require user input or contain their personal info, are not HTTPS encrypted. Ebay uses mixed web page content, meaning some pages use encrypted connections while others do not. As a standard best practice, all pages that either require user input or contain personal data should be HTTPS-encrypted. While Ebay does use HTTPS on its most critical pages, such as those where payment or address information is entered, it lacks encryption on several less critical, but still sensitive pages. When customers send and receive messages from sellers, for example, their communications are not sent over a private channel. Not only could a hacker intercept and read messages, they could modify them in what\u2019s known as a \u201cman-in-the-middle\u201d attack. This could lead to fraud or spam being sent from user accounts. Ebay does block certain types of information from being exchanged over its internal messages system. It\u2019s member-to-member contact policy states: We also don\u2019t allow members to exchange email addresses, phone numbers or other contact information, web addresses, or links within eBay messaging systems. This is primarily to prevent buyers and sellers from arranging transactions outside of the Ebay system. It does help protect user privacy to a degree, but it\u2019s only a half measure compared to the full channel encryption provided by HTTPS. The entire My Ebay dashboard lacks HTTPS encryption. This includes account activity, details, settings, preferences, and more. Much of the personal information on these pages is obfuscated; for example, my email is shown as \u201cp\u2026f@gmail.com\u201d instead of the full email address. All secret questions are shown in full, for example, though not their answers. Still, if a hacker knew secret questions in advance, he or she could probably dig around for the answers. Info about friends, pets, and family are probably not so hard to come by. Once that\u2019s done, the hacker can change the user\u2019s password and take over their account.

Public charging ports are installed almost everywhere for the users and vicitors convenience such as at airports, conference centers, cafes, parks and planes, etc. All you need to do is plug in your cell phone and feel relaxed and relieved. However, Drew Paik from IT security security firm Authentic8\u00a0told CNN that this is a very dangerous thing to do because the outlet might be hacked and all the data present in your phone could easily be transferred to a hacker. Authentic8 is the developer of Silo web browser that facilitates anonymous web surfing. The revelation from Paik is surprising and concerning as he states that simply through plugging in your phone into a hacked charger or power strip would lead to getting your device infected at once and all your data will also be compromised. The reason is that the cord used to plug in your mobile phone is also used for sending data to and from the device. For example, if you connect your iPhone to your Mac device using the same charging cord, you can easily transfer images and music from your mobile to your Mac. Hence, through compromising this particular cord, a hacker can extract all sorts of data from your mobile including pictures, emails, contact numbers, SMS messages, etc., without your knowledge obviously. The company installed a charging station at its stall and offered to charge cords to visitors so that they could charge their devices. Then the security firm ran a social experiment to analyze the number of people who used this charging service, which turned out to be quite overwhelming with over 80% of the audience using the charging facility provided by Authentic8. Paik noted that none of these visitors seemed to care about the security aspect of charging mobiles from a public station despite the fact that they were attending a security conference. The repercussions are various and diverse, which is why Paik recommends that instead of putting their data in danger, users must carry their chargers or invest in portable USB battery pack. They may also buy USB cords of their own and connect the chargers using their ports. The bottom line is that, if you are concerned about the security of your phone\u2019s data, it is better to stop using public ports at all.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: be compromised, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: can extract, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The attacks look like an evolution of the MongoDB ransomware attacks first reported earlier this year by Victor Gevers. Similarly to the MongoDB attacks, owners are instructed to pay a 0.2 Bitcoin ransom (approx.$200) to regain access to their content. We saw two very similar variations of the attack using two bitcoin wallets. In this post we will describe in detail the attack flow and provide some recommendations on how to protect your databases from similar attacks along with attack IoCs. The attacks started at midnight at 00:15 on February 12 and lasted about 30 hours in which hundreds of attacks were reported by GGSN. We were able to trace all the attacks\u00a0to 109.236.88.20, an IP address hosted by worldstream.nl, a Netherlands-based web hosting company. The attacker is (probably) running from a compromised mail server which also serves as HTTP(s) and FTP server. Worldstream was notified a few days after we reported the attack. The attack starts with \u2018root\u2019 password brute-forcing. Once logged-in, it fetches a list of the existing MySQL databases and their tables and creates a new table called \u2018WARNING\u2019 that includes a contact email address, a bitcoin address and a payment demand. In one variant of the attack the table is added to an existing database; in other cases the table is added to a newly created database called \u2018PLEASE_READ\u2019. The attacker will then delete the databases stored on the server and disconnect, sometimes without even dumping them first. The attack as reported by GuardiCore Centra We logged two versions of the ransom message: INSERT INTO PLEASE_READ.`WARNING`(id, warning, Bitcoin_Address, Email) VALUES(\u20181\u2032,\u2019Send 0.2 BTC to this address and contact this email with your ip or db_name of your server to recover your database!

Finnish security vendor F-Secure yesterday released 34 pages of transcripts from the group chat used by the crafters of the Spora ransomware family. The back-and-forth not only put a spotlight on the gang's customer support chops, but, said a company security advisor, illustrated the intertwining of Bitcoin and extortion malware. \"We should be thankful that there are at least some practical barriers to purchase Bitcoins,\" wrote Sean Sullivan of F-Secure in a Wednesday post to the firm's blog. \"If it were any easier to do so, very little else would check the growth of crypto-ransomware's business model.\" Sullivan originally penned that conclusion last month, in a short section of the \"State of Cyber Security\" report that F-Secure published then. Yesterday, F-Secure posted the transcripts, 20,000 words or more, and dubbed the collection a \"new supplemental appendix\" to the original report. In one exchange, a Spora victim said he or she had paid the extortion fee, but had gotten nothing in return. \"The malware technology to encrypt data has been possible for many, many years; the bigger challenge has always been getting paid,\" Sullivan pointed out. \"In the past, cyber-crime schemes (such as scareware) have been killed off by disrupting the money supply.

He said searches using the Shodan computer search engine and other evidence indicated that, since December 25 and January 8, the customer data was accessed multiple times by multiple parties, including criminals who ultimately held the data for ransom. The recordings were available on an Amazon-hosted service that required no authorization to access. The data was exposed by Spiral Toys, maker of the CloudPets line of stuffed animals. The toys record and play voice messages that can be sent over the Internet by parents and children. The MongoDB database of 821,296 account records was stored by a Romanian company called mReady, which Spiral Toys appears to have contracted with. Hunt said that, on at least four occasions, people attempted to notify the toy maker of the breach. In any event, evidence left behind by the ransom demanders made it almost certain company officials knew of the intrusions. Hunt wrote: It's impossible to believe that CloudPets (or mReady) did not know that firstly, the databases had been left publicly exposed and secondly, that malicious parties had accessed them. Obviously, they've changed the security profile of the system, and you simply could not have overlooked the fact that a ransom had been left. So both the exposed database and intrusion by those demanding the ransom must have been identified yet this story never made the headlines.

Oddly enough, for a product with such lax security, the service used the ultra-secure bcrypt hashing function to protect passwords.

The breach, which grabbed headlines on Monday, is drawing concerns from security researchers because it may have given hackers access to voice recordings from the toy's customers. But the company behind the products, Spiral Toys, is denying that any customers were hacked. Absolutely not,\" said Mark Meyers, CEO of the company. Security researcher Troy Hunt, who tracks data breaches, brought the incident to light on Monday. Hackers appear to have accessed an exposed CloudPets' database, which contained email addresses and hashed passwords, and they even sought to ransom the information back in January, he said\u00a0in a blog post. The incident underscores the danger with connected devices, including toys, and how data passing through them can be exposed, he added. In the case of CloudPets, the brand allegedly made the mistake of storing the customer information in a publicly exposed online MongoDB database that required no authentication to access. That allowed anyone, including hackers, to view and steal the data. On the plus side, the passwords exposed in the breach are hashed with the bcrypt algorithm, making them difficult to crack. Unfortunately, CloudPets placed no requirement on password strength, meaning that even a single character such as letter \"a\" was acceptable, according to Hunt, who was given a copy of the stolen data last week. As a result, Hunt was able to decipher a large number of the passwords, by simply checking them against common terms such as qwerty, 123456, and cloudpets. \"Anyone with the data could crack a large number of passwords, log on to accounts and pull down the voice recordings,\" Hunt said in his blog post. Security researcher Victor Gevers from the GDI Foundation said he also discovered the exposed database from CloudPets and tried to contact the toy maker in late December. However, both Gevers and Hunt said the company never responded to their repeated warnings. On Monday, California-based Spiral Toys, which operates the CloudPets brand, claimed the company never received the warnings. \"The headlines that say 2 million messages were leaked on the internet are completely false,\"\u00a0Meyers said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: a data breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: The breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: access, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were hacked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the incident, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: have accessed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The incident, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: can be exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: a publicly exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

A malicious actor would only be able to access a customer's voice recording if they managed to guess the password, he said. \"We have to find a balance,\" Meyers said, when he addressed the toy maker's lack of password strength requirements. He also said that Spiral Toys had outsourced its server management to a third-party vendor. In January, the company implemented changes MongoDB requested to increase the server's security. Spiral Toys hasn\u2019t been the only company targeted. In recent months, several hacking groups have been attacking thousands of publicly exposed MongoDB databases. They\u2019ve done so by erasing the data, and then saying they can restore it, but only if victims pay a ransom fee. In the CloudPets incident, different hackers appear to have deleted the original databases, but left ransom notes on the exposed systems, Hunt said. Although the CloudPets\u2019 databases are no longer publicly accessible, it appears that the toy maker hasn\u2019t notified customers about the breach, Hunt said. The danger is that hackers might be using the stolen information to break into customer accounts registered with the toys. But Meyers said the company found no evidence that any hackers broke into customer accounts.

Forty-seven states, including Washington, have legislation on the books that requires companies or government entities to disclose whenever there\u2019s been a breach of personally identifiable information. Under Washington law, companies are required to notify the Attorney General\u2019s office if the incident affects more than 500 of the state\u2019s residents. In this instance Boeing claims the information of 7,288 Washington residents may have been impacted. According to the letter, the breach occurred on Nov.\u00a021, 2016 after a Boeing employee encountered a formatting issue and emailed a spreadsheet to his spouse who didn\u2019t work at the company. The file contained sensitive, personally identifiable information of 36,000 of the aircraft manufacturer\u2019s employees. The file included the names, places of birth, BEMSID, or employee ID numbers, and accounting department codes. The spreadsheet also included Social security numbers and dates of birth, albeit in \u201chidden columns,\u201d according to Olson. Spreadsheet software, such as\u00a0Microsoft\u2019s Excel, usually allows authors to make select information hidden, usually to prevent that data from being seen, changed, or deleted. According to Olson\u2019s letter, the breach was discovered earlier this year, on Jan.\u00a09, but the company didn\u2019t begin to inform employees until a month later, Feb.\u00a08. In the letter to Ferguson, Boeing claims it destroyed copies of the spreadsheet and carried out a \u201cforensic examination\u201d of both the Boeing employee\u2019s computer and his spouse\u2019s to ensure it was deleted. \u201cBoth the employee and his spouse have confirmed to us that they have not distributed or used any of the information,\u201d Olson writes.

The group was exporting the database's content and replacing all tables with one named WARNING, that contained a ransom note, asking the owners of the hacked database to pay 0.2 Bitcoin (~$200) into Bitcoin wallet. At the time of our article, Harak1r1 had hijacked just over 1,800 MongoDB databases, and 11 victims have paid the ransom in order to recover their files. As time went by, Harak1r1 hijacked more databases, reaching at one point over 3,500 MongoDB instances, and currently peaking at over 8,500. Among them, the hacker(s) had even managed to make a high-profile victim, in Emory Healthcare, a US-based healthcare organization. According to the MacKeeper Security Research Team, Harak1r1 had ransacked and blocked Emory's access to more than 200,000 medical records. Attacks from harak1r1 went on for two more days, but as worldwide infosec media started covering the topic, two copycats appeared and started doing the same. The second group goes by the name of 0wn3d, and they work by replacing the hijacked database tables with a table named WARNING_ALERT. According to Victor Gevers, the researcher who initially discovered the first hacked MongoDBs around Christmas, this second group has hijacked just over 930 databases. Unlike Harak1r1, this second group is a little bit more greedy and asks for 0.5 Bitcoin, which is around $500, but this hasn't stopped companies from paying, with 0wn3d's Bitcoin wallet showing that at least three victims had paid his ransom demands. A day later, the same Gevers came across a third actor, using the name 0704341626asdf, which appears to have hit over 740 MongoDB servers.

Additionally, in newer variations of these attacks, the hackers don't appear to bother copying the hacked database. In recent attacks, Gevers says that crooks just delete the DB's content, ask for a ransom regardless, and hope nobody checks the logs and discovers what they've done. There is no evidence that they actual copied your database. According to Gevers, these groups are now fighting over the same turf, with many of them rewriting each other's ransom notes. This leads to cases where database owners pay the ransom to the wrong group, who can't give their content back. \"It's catching on and it looks more players are coming to the game.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: recent attacks, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ask for a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The cost of ransomware reached close to $1 billion in 2016, and it's not hard to see why. The malware family, which targets everything from Windows to Mac machines, executes procedures to encrypt files and disks before demanding a ransom payment in return for keys to decrypt and unlock compromised machines. However, it is not only the general public which is being targeted with everything from hospitals to schools and businesses now in the firing line. As the prospect of losing valuable content on computer systems or facing widespread disruption to business operations is often too much to bear, many will simply give up and give in, paying the fee and unfortunately contributing to the cybercriminal's operations. However, paying up does not guarantee that victims will get their files back, no matter how low or high the payment demand. This week, ESET researchers discovered that a Linux variant of KillDisk, linked to attacks against core infrastructure system in Ukraine in 2015, is now being used against fresh Ukrainian financial targets. The ransomware demands a huge amount of money, but there is no underwritten protocol for decryption keys to be released once payment is made. Distributed through phishing campaigns targeting both Windows and Linux, once downloaded, the ransomware throws up a holding page referring to the Mr. Robot television show while files are being encrypted, the research team said in a blog post. Unsurprisingly, no-one has paid up yet, nor should they, ever. \"This new variant renders Linux machines unbootable, after encrypting files and requesting a large ransom,\" ESET says. \"But even if victims do reach deep into their pockets, the probability that the attackers will decrypt the files is small.\" Files are encrypted using Triple-DES applied to 4096-byte file blocks and each file is encrypted using different sets of 64-bit encryption keys. However, the ransomware does not store encryption keys either locally or through a command-and-control (C&C) server, which means that affected systems after reboot are unbootable, and paying the ransom is pointless. \"It is important to note -- that paying the ransom demanded for the recovery of encrypted files is a waste of time and money,\" the team said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: asks for, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payment is made, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanding a ransom payment, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying up, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the payment demand, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: The ransomware demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: payment is made, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: phishing campaigns, Event Type: Attack:Phishing;\nTrigger: requesting a large ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying the ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying the ransom demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The notification says that the company was not aware of a breach until Feb 22 when it received an inquiry from a Motherboard reporter who was informed by researchers Troy Hunt and Victor Gevers of a serious issue involving the toymaker\u2019s customer data. This runs contrary to timelines provided by Hunt and Gevers showing both reached out to a number of Spiral Toys contacts, including its ZenDesk ticketing system, around Dec 30. The data was copied and deleted from an exposed MongoDB instance found online. It\u2019s unknown how many times the database was accessed before its contents were deleted and a ransom note left behind, symptomatic of other attacks against poorly protected MongoDB databases. The recordings were not stored in the database, but the database did contain references to file paths to the messages, which were stored on an Amazon Web Services AWS S3 storage bucket. The database, Spiral Toys said in its notification, did include emails and encrypted passwords, which Hunt counters were not encrypted, but were hashed with bcrypt. Combined with a nonexistent password strength rule on Spiral Toys\u2019 part, the hashed passwords could easily be cracked, Hunt said. The company meanwhile said it would notify 500,000 affected users, force a password reset, and implement new password strength requirements. Hunt and Gevers said there were actually more than 800,000 registered users exposed in the breach. \u201cThe breach has been addressed and from our best knowledge no images or messages were leaked onto the internet,\u201d Spiral Toys said. \u201cA hacker could get to that data if they started \u2018guessing\u2019 simple passwords\u201d.

A month before that, it was used against a major news agency in Ukraine. Since then, KillDisk has been used in other attacks, most recently against several targets from the shipping sector, according to security researchers from antivirus vendor ESET. However, the latest versions have evolved and now act like ransomware. Instead of wiping the data from the disk, the malware encrypts it and displays a message asking for 222 bitcoins to restore them. That's the equivalent of $216,000, an unusually large sum of money for a ransomware attack. What's even more interesting is that there's also a Linux variant of KillDisk that can infect both desktop and server systems, the ESET researchers said Thursday in blog post. The encryption routine and algorithms are different between the Windows and the Linux versions, and on Linux, there's another catch: The encryption keys are neither saved locally nor sent to a command-and-control server, and the attackers can't actually get to them. \"The cyber criminals behind this KillDisk variant cannot supply their victims with the decryption keys to recover their files, despite those victims paying the extremely large sum demanded by this ransomware,\" the ESET researchers said. The good news is that there's a weakness in the encryption mechanism for the Linux version that makes it possible -- though difficult -- for the victim to recover the files. It's not clear why the KillDisk creators have added this encryption feature. It could be that they're achieving the same goal as in the past -- destruction of data -- but with the ransomware tactic there's also a small chance that they'll walk away with a large sum of money[/INST]\n\nTrigger: asking for, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: a ransomware attack, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: paying, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: demanded, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

The array of vulnerabilities identified in the systems evaluated included many graded as high or critical risk, leaving the robots highly susceptible to attack. Attackers could employ the issues found to maliciously spy via the robot\u2019s microphone and camera, leak personal or business data, and in extreme cases, cause serious physical harm or damage to people and property in the vicinity of a hacked robot. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that robots and the application of Artificial Intelligence have become the new norm and the way of the future,\u201d said Cesar Cerrudo, CTO at IOActive. \u201cRobots will soon be everywhere \u2013 from toys to personal assistants to manufacturing workers \u2013 the list is endless. Given this proliferation, focusing on cybersecurity is vital in ensuring these robots are safe and don\u2019t present serious cyber or physical threats to the people and organisations they\u2019re intended to serve\u201d. During the past six months, IOActive\u2019s researchers tested mobile applications, robot operating systems, firmware images, and other software in order to identify the flaws in several robots from vendors, including: \u201cIn this research, we focused on home, business, and industrial robots, in addition to robot control software used by several robot vendors,\u201d said Lucas Apa, Senior Security Consultant at IOActive. \u201cGiven the huge attack surface, we found nearly 50 cybersecurity vulnerabilities in our initial research alone, ranging from insecure communications and authentication issues, to weak cryptography, memory corruption, and privacy problems, just to name a few\u201d. According to Cerrudo and Apa, once a vulnerability has been exploited, a hacker could potentially gain control of the robot for cyber espionage, turn a robot into an insider threat, use a robot to expose private information, or cause a robot to perform unwanted actions when interacting with people, business operations, or other robots. In the most extreme cases, robots could be used to cause serious physical damage and harm to people and property. As robots become smarter, threats will also increase.

Researchers at IOActive Labs released a report Wednesday warning that consumer, industrial and service robots in use today have serious security vulnerabilities making them easy targets for\u00a0hackers or accidental breaches. In a review of 10\u00a0robots, which ranged from home, business, and industrial, IOActive said the\u00a0risks ranged from insecure communications, authentication issues, weak cryptography and missing authorization. Cesar Cerrudo, CTO of IOActive Labs, said robots suffer from many of the same security shortcomings of as IoT, medical devices, smart cars and plush toys. \u201cWe found nearly 50 cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the robot ecosystem components, many of which were common problems,\u201d according to the IOActive Labs report. As part of its investigation, IOActive\u00a0analyzed some robot hardware as well as robot ecosystems. Some of the robots examined included SoftBank Robotics\u2019 NAO and Pepper robots, UBTECH Robotics\u2019 Alpha 1S and Alpha 2 robots and Rethink Robotics\u2019 Baxter and Sawyer robots. Underlying issues within the robots studied for the report, Cerrudo said, included weak default configurations, a big security problem responsible for privacy breaches and DDoS attacks in other internet-connected devices. \u201cWe found robots with insecure features that couldn\u2019t be easily disabled or protected, as well as features with default passwords that were either difficult to change or could not be changed at all,\u201d according to the report. In a closer examination of the robot ecosystems, IOActive Labs said many of the robot platforms it analyzed use open source frameworks and libraries that suffer from known vulnerabilities\u00a0such as cleartext communication, authentication issues, and weak authorization schemes. \u201cIn the robotics community, it seems common to share software frameworks, libraries, operating systems, etc., for robot development and programming. This isn\u2019t bad if the software is secure; unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the case here,\u201d according to IOActive Labs. Cerrudo said the threat of robots is unique in that many are semiautonomous and can wander and impact their immediate physical environment. \u201cThe threat is limited today, compared to what robots will be capable of in the future,\u201d he said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: released a report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: the IOActive Labs report, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: said, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: analyzed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

When asked, Cerrudo could not point to any known cases of a hacked robot causing personal harm or posing a security risk. Nevertheless, he\u00a0cited several robot-related accidents that he said demonstrate potential risks posed by a hacked robot. In one case cited by IOActive Labs, a woman was killed in an industrial accident in 2015 in Alabama when an industrial robot restarted abruptly. It cited additional loss of life incidents tied to robotic functions within computerized medical and military equipment. \u201cWe aren\u2019t aware of any robots that have been hacked. But security of the robots we tested are very poor. Eventually in the future, when robots are more mainstream, we expect cybercriminals will start seeing hacking robots as a way to make money,\u201d said Lucas Apa, senior security consultant with IOActive Labs. That timeline of mass robot adoption is still a little foggy, according to Apa. According to market research firm IDC, worldwide spending on robots will reach $188 billion by 2020, up from $91.5 billion in 2016. According to IDC many of those robots will include consumer, industrial, and service robots for industries such as healthcare and retail. \u201cThe industry doesn\u2019t appear to learn from it\u2019s mistakes,\u201d Cerrudo said.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

In a lengthy\u00a0SEC filing, the board claimed that in late 2014 the firm\u2019s security team notified of targeted attacks against 26 users, who were subsequently informed, and law enforcement consulted. It continued: \u201cWhile significant additional security measures were implemented in response to those incidents, it appears certain senior executives did not properly comprehend or investigate, and therefore failed to act sufficiently upon, the full extent of knowledge known internally by the Company\u2019s information security team. Specifically, as of December 2014, the information security team understood that the attacker had exfiltrated copies of user database backup files containing the personal data of Yahoo users but it is unclear whether and to what extent such evidence of exfiltration was effectively communicated and understood outside the information security team\u201d. Subsequent cookie forging activity by the same state actor in 2015 and 2016 was also not investigated. That activity is now said to have exposed the accounts of 32 million users. The revelations would seem to indicate a massive disconnect between IT security and the business at Yahoo \u2013 perhaps one of the reasons why former CISO Alex Stamos left for Facebook in 2015. It should be a cautionary tale for businesses everywhere, as the fallout continues. General counsel and secretary, Ronald Bell, will leave the company as a result of the investigation with no severance pay, and CEO Marissa Meyer will not receive a cash bonus for 2016. She has also agreed not to receive her 2017 annual equity award \u2013 which is said to be more than $10m. The firm revealed it has already recorded $16m in losses related to the 2013 and 2014 breaches \u2013 \u201cof which $5 million was associated with the ongoing forensic investigation and remediation activities and $11 million was associated with nonrecurring legal costs\u201d.

An Action Fraud notice claimed that the fraudsters have been cold calling education institutions pretending to be government officials and socially engineering the victim into giving them the email address of the head teacher, in order to send across \u201csensitive information\u201d. The resulting email contains a .zip attachment loaded with ransomware that will apparently demand up to \u00a38000 to recover the files. Action Fraud claimed similar cases have been noted where the fraudsters pretend to be calling from the Department for Work and Pensions, or even telecom\u00a0providers. The newly reported incidents represent an escalation in tactics designed to get ransomware on the networks of targets presumably selected because they may be relatively poorly secured, and be willing to pay a high penalty to gain access back to their data. \u201cOnce again, hackers have preyed on the weakest link in security \u2013 the end-user \u2013 but this is not where the fault lies.

The issue is with the authentication process, allowing a remote attacker to gain a shell with root privileges on an affected device, Trustwave researcher Neil Kettle explained in a blog post. \u201cThe Telnet interface of the GoIP is documented as providing information for users of the device through the use of logins \u2018ctlcmd\u2019 and \u2018limitsh\u2019. However, an additional undocumented user, namely \u2018dbladm\u2019 is present which provides root level shell access on the device. Instead of a traditional password, this account is protected by a proprietary challenge-response authentication scheme,\u201d he explained. \u201cInvestigation has shown this scheme to be fundamentally flawed in that it is not necessary for a remote user to possess knowledge of any secret besides the challenge itself and knowledge of the protocol/computation\u201d. This is apparently in contrast to more secure challenge-response schemes such as password-based log-ins where the user is asked for a password, which is then obscured to guard against \u201cnetwork interception and replay attacks\u201d. The issue was first spotted by Trustwave in an 8 port VoIP GSM Gateway from the company. However, it\u2019s since been discovered present in GoIP 1, 4, 8, 16 and 32 and could affect many more DBL Technology devices and OEM kit. More worryingly, when contacted last October, the firm did not fix the issue. \u201cVerification of the patched version reveals that the challenge response mechanism is still present in the latest version albeit a little more complex. It seems DBL Technology engineers did not understand that the issue is the presence of a flawed challenge response mechanism and not the difficulty of reverse engineering it,\u201d explained Kettle. \u201cThe main differences between the latest challenge response mechanism and the older variant is the level of complexity it employs: a simplistic MD5 with a linear equation changed to several 'round' functions mixed with a modified version of the MD5 hash algorithm\u201d[/INST]\n\nTrigger: are warning, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: explained, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: was first spotted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: been discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: could affect, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}

Prince said there is no evidence the vulnerability, which leaked customer data from memory, was exploited by attackers. The bug, however, was triggered more than 1.2 million times from 6,500 sites that met the criteria under which it could be exploited. In the meantime, Cloudflare continues to work with Google and other search engine providers to scrub cached sites that could contain any leaked data from memory. \u201cWe\u2019ve successfully removed more than 80,000 unique cached pages. That underestimates the total number because we\u2019ve requested search engines purge and recrawl entire sites in some instances,\u201d Prince said. Prince said leaks have included internal Cloudflare headers and customer cookies, but no evidence of passwords, encryption keys, payment card data or health records among the leaks. The vulnerability was privately disclosed Feb 17 by Google Project Zero researcher Tavis Ormandy, who reported that he did see crypto keys, passwords, POST data and HTTPS requests for other Cloudflare-hosted sites among data from other requests. Ormandy initially said in a tweet that Cloudflare was leaking customer HTTPS sessions for Uber, FitBit, OKCupid and others, all of which said the impact of Cloudbleed on their data was minimal. \u201cWhile the bug was very bad and had the potential to be much worse,\u201d Prince said. Prince explained that the bug was triggered only when a webpage moving through the Cloudflare network contained HTML ending with an un-terminated attribute, and if a number of Cloudflare features were turned on. Those features hand in hand with a Cloudflare stream parser used to scan and modify content in real time such as rewriting HTTP links to HTTPS\u2014a feature called Automatic HTTPS Rewrites\u2014or hiding email addresses on a page from spammers\u2014a feature called Email Address Obfuscation.

Instead, the parser continued to read from adjacent memory, which contained data from other customers\u2019 requests. The contents of that adjacent memory were then dumped onto the page with the flawed HTML\u201d. Anyone accessing one of those pages would see the memory dump, looking a lot like random text, below, Prince said. An attacker would need to pound one of those sites with numerous requests to trigger the bug and then record the results, getting a mix of useless data and sensitive information, Prince said. \u201cThe nightmare scenario we have been worried about is if a hacker had been aware of the bug and had been quietly mining data before we were notified by Google\u2019s Project Zero team and were able to patch it,\u201d Prince said. \u201cFor the last 12 days we\u2019ve been reviewing our logs to see if there\u2019s any evidence to indicate that a hacker was exploiting the bug before it was patched.

That's Cloudflare's initial postmortem conclusion after a twelve-day review of log data related to the breach. The review showed no evidence that attackers had exploited the flaw prior to it being discovered and patched, Cloudflare CEO and founder Matthew Prince said in a blog Wednesday. A \"vast majority\" of Cloudflare's customers also did not appear to have had any of their data leaked. Cloudflare\u2019s inspection of tens of thousands of pages that were leaked from its reverse-proxy servers and cached by search engines revealed a \"large number\" of instances of internal Cloudflare cookies and headers. But so far, according to Prince, there\u2019s no evidence that passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data were compromised as was initially feared. The Cloudflare security snafu stemmed from the manner in which a stream parser application that the company uses to modify content passing through its edge servers handled HTTP requests. The bug caused the parser to read memory not only from the HTML page that was being actually parsed, but also from adjacent memory that contained data in response to HTTP requests made by other customers. The flaw was triggered only when pages with certain specific attributes were requested through Cloudflare\u2019s CDN. \"If you had accessed one of the pages that triggered the bug you would have seen what likely looked like random text at the end of the page,\" Prince said. A lot of the leaked data ended up getting cached by search engines and Web scrapers. A security researcher from Google\u2019s Project Zero threat hunting team alerted Cloudfare to the bug last month. The company claimed it fixed the problem in a matter of hours after being notified of the problem. Some have compared the breach to Heartbleed and have even called it Cloudbleed. In his blog, Prince compared the threat posed by the bug to that posed by a stranger eavesdropping on a random conversation between two employees. Most of the time, the stranger would likely hear nothing of value, but occasionally might pick up something confidential.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: being leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the breach, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: being discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: their data leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: were leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: alerted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fixed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: notified, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: pick up, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

The customers most at risk of having their data exposed were those that sent the most requests through Cloudflare\u2019s CDN. Cloudflare\u2019s detailed postmortem and mea culpa evoked a mixed response from security experts. Ilia Kolochenko, CEO of Web security firm High-Tech Bridge praised Prince\u2019s effort to be transparent about what went down. \"Even if we cannot verify the accuracy of all the numbers inside\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for the moment, I don\u2019t have a valid reason to question either its content, or conclusion,\" Kolochenko says. In fact, until someone can come up with a credible rebuttal of Cloudflare\u2019s internal investigation, it\u2019s inappropriate to compare what happened at the company to Heartbleed. \"I\u2019d say it\u2019s inappropriate even to call this particular incident a 'Cloudbleed,'\" he says. \"In the Heartbleed case, almost every company in the world, many software vendors including cybersecurity companies, were seriously impacted by the vulnerability.\" Heartbleed also resulted in multiple breaches and many organizations continue to be exposed to the threat. Neither of those situations applies to the Cloudflare security lapse. \"All avenues of\u00a0Cloudflare\u2019s vulnerability exploitation seems to be mitigated by now,\" he says. But Kunal Anand, CTO of application security vendor Prevoty, says the details Cloudflare has shared aren't exactly reassuring. If no sensitive information like credit numbers and Social Security Numbers were leaked and the leaked dataset itself was relatively small, there is no reason why Cloudflare shouldn't share it with a third-party for an unbiased review, he says. \"CloudFlare needs to realize that HTTP headers, including cookies, contain sensitive information like session identifiers, authorization tokens and IP addresses,\" Anand says. \"All of these data points should count as private data.\" CloudFlare has been working with various search engines to purge their caches, but in the process, any evidence of the data that was leaked is being deleted as well.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: known about, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: fix, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: multiple breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: be exposed, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: mitigated, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: were leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: was leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Cisco warns the vulnerability, \u201ccould allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to hang or unexpectedly reload, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition\u201d. The bug\u00a0(CVE-2017-3826) is due to incomplete validation of SCTP packets being monitored on the NGA data ports, Cisco wrote. It impacts Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliances NGA 3140, NGA 3240 and NGA 3340. NetFlow Generation Appliances are located within enterprise data centers and designed to monitor Gigabit Ethernet high-throughput networks. An attacker exploiting the vulnerability, \u201ccould exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed SCTP packets on a network that is monitored by an NGA data port. SCTP packets addressed to the IP address of the NGA itself will not trigger this vulnerability. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the appliance to become unresponsive or reload, causing a DoS condition,\u201d Cisco said. While there are no workarounds to fix the vulnerability, Cisco is urging users to apply an\u00a0update that fixes the bug, Cisco NetFlow Generation Appliance Software release 1.1 (1a). The company added that the fix does not apply to NGA 3140 because that platform was sunsetted January 11, 2014.

And this time it wants to steal your passwords too. Cybercriminals are always adding new malicious tricks to ransomware. A ransomware variant which has been relatively inactive for almost two years is back, and this time it's stealing user credentials from victims in addition to demanding a ransom to unencrypt locked files. TorrentLocker -- also known as Cryptolocker -- started targeting Windows users in 2014 before dropping off by the summer of 2015. Like the majority of ransomware schemes,  TorrentLocker spreads via spam email messages  containing malicious attachments. Rising Bitcoin prices force Cryptolocker ransomware scammers to drop asking price Bitcoin's wild fluctuations have forced a price update to the Cryptolocker ransomware. If the victim enables the macros by choosing to 'Enable Editing', a PowerShell code is executed and the ransomware is downloaded, encrypting the victims' files until they pay a ransom. But that isn't where the malicious activity ends, because as noted by cybersecurity researchers at Heimdal Security, this incarnation of TorrentLocker has new features, including the ability to spread itself to other computers via shared files; something which could see the ransomware taking over a whole network in a very short space of time. In addition to holding networks to ransom, the new version of TorrentLocker also harvests usernames and passwords from infected computers, putting businesses at risk of cyberespionage and data breaches, while users could see their personal or financial information leaked and sold to cybercriminals on the dark web. The researchers warn that the revived TorrentLocker campaign is \"very aggressive\" and that many well known antivirus software products haven't been updated to protect against it, even days after the campaign began. Heimdal Security warns users in its native Denmark that they're being highly targeted by TorrentLocker. Indeed, it appears that European internet users are the main target for those behind the campaign, as Microsoft told BleepingComputer that Italy is by far the most targeted by the perpetrators.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: steal, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: stealing, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: demanding a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: drop asking price, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: pay a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: harvests, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: data breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: leaked, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

It has caused absolute terror in nearly every industry, affecting almost 50% of organizations in 2016, and is considered one of the top cyberthreats\u00a0to the enterprise for 2017. According to the FBI, ransomware \u2014 malware that holds systems and data for ransom \u2014\u00a0cost victims $209 million in the first three months of 2016, yet totaled only $24 million in all of 2015. This astronomical rise in ransomware is motivated, in large part, by a lack of preparedness. And the problem will get worse before it gets better. But in order to understand the rise of ransomware, you need to understand its economics. The Business of RansomwareTraditional data from major breaches is starting to be worth less and less as the black market gets flooded with stolen records. Just call a toll-free number and the problem is fixed in minutes. Even the cost of prized electronic healthcare records is down 50% to 60% from last year. But at the same time, the price per ransom has continued to climb, and much of the data being ransomed is completely worthless on the black market. Innovations in online payments have also helped pave the way for the current ransomware epidemic. Similar to how some sites are the middlemen for sellers, Web-based \"businesses\" started to appear in early 2016 to act as proxies for data extortionists to post sensitive stolen data to add urgency to payment demands, sell the stolen data to a third-party, or utilize it in other ways. These Web vendors use a \"Business 101\" approach by providing an easy Bitcoin-based payment interface \u2014 currently worth $768 each (at the time of writing this) \u2014 and take a cut of every payment. Popularity Breeds PandemicBecause of ransomware's massive success, its creators are pushing new technologies to their limits, with the potential to infiltrate every data storage device between the Internet and any given company. And with the massive success of Mirai \u2014 the Internet of Things botnet that took down a portion of the Internet last fall \u2014 connected devices are poised to become the next big target, translating into even more ransomware.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: breaches, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: the data being ransomed, Event Type: Attack:Ransom;\nTrigger: post, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: payment demands, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

According to Zenofex multiple WD MyCloud NAS device models are affected, such as: Zenofex's decision not to inform Western Digital came after the researcher attended a security conference last year, where other infosec professionals complained about Western Digital ignoring vulnerability reports. It was at the same conference, Black Hat USA 2016, where Western Digital also won a Pwnie Award in a category called \"Lamest Vendor Response.\" \"Ignoring these bugs would leave the vulnerable devices online for longer periods while responsible disclosure is worked out,\" Zenofex argued his decision not to wait until Western Digital patches the security bugs. \"Instead we\u2019re attempting to alert the community of the flaws and hoping that users remove their devices from any public facing portions of their networks, limiting access wherever possible,\" he added. Zenofex, who's a member of the Exploitee.rs community, says he found a whopping total of 85 security issues. Based on the exploit code, many of these security flaws can be exploited by altering cookie values or embedding shell commands in cookie parameters. When the image loads inside their browser, the exploit code executes against the local NAS drive and takes over the device. The most severe of these issues, according to Zenofex, is authentication bypass issue, which ironically was also the easiest to exploit, requiring only the modification of cookie session parameters. And since Murphy's Law applies to hardware devices as well, things went wrong all the way, and the commands aren't executed under a limited user, but run under root, giving attackers full control over affected devices, allowing them to upload or download data at will.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: Discovered, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have not been reported, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: are still unpatched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: are affected, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: inform, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: vulnerability reports, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: responsible disclosure, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: patches, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: alert, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be exploited, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Those queries were along the lines of, \u201cWhat do you detect it as?\u201d The simple answer is Troj/Ransom-ECZ, which is what we replied back then, but there\u2019s a backstory to the Satan malware family that we thought was worth covering, too. Cybercriminals have long used themes like the devil, the occult and what you might rather loosely call \u201cthe dark arts\u201d as inspiration for malware names: Dark Avenger, Necropolis, Mydoom, Natas (which is Satan backwards) and SatanBug are just a few examples But there\u2019s one aspect of the Satan ransomware that isn\u2019t old-school, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at in this article: its business model. In its own words, the malware part of Satan is simply explained: Satan is a ransomware, a malicious software that once opened in a Windows system, encrypts all the files, and demands a ransom for the decryption tools. Satan has brazenly copied the business model of many legitimate online services such as iTunes and eBay: joining up is free, but you pay-as-you-go on a percentage basis when you put business through the site. The Satan service claims to: The service (we'll use that word without quotation marks, but you may infer them if you wish) even supports optional two-factor authentication based on a public-private key pair, just like SSH, and a CAPTCHA to make automatic mass signups more difficult. Once you have a login, you can begin to generate ransomware samples, tailored to your own price point. You can choose an initial ransom, starting at BTC 0.1 (about $125 on 2017-03-07), the number of days you want to keep the price at its starting point, and a \"ramp up\" factor by which the ransom will increase after the initial period: Once you've created a sample, you can not only download it to start attacking potential victims, but also generate a series of supporting files that will help you to use it in an attack.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: demands a ransom, Event Type: Attack:Ransom</s>"}

Of course, once you have scrambled your ransomware files, you can't just send the files or links to your victims and expect them to work, because the files will arrive in scrambled form and won't run. The Satan service helps you over that step, too, by creating either an HTML page or a Microsoft Word macro to do the job of downloading, unscrambling and auto-launching the decoded malware. You then convert the HTML into CHM (compiled HTML) format or embed the generated Word macro into a Word document, thus creating a malware downloader file you can send as an email attachment and entice your victim to open it. If you do manage to infect a prospective victim, they\u2019ll be instructed to pay the ransom you specified, but into a bitcoin wallet operated by the crooks: You\u2019re then expected to trust the crooks to be honest about all the payments they receive, and to cough up 70% of every ransom payment into a bitcoin address you supply them. We shouldn\u2019t have to say this, but the answer is dead simple: DON\u2019T. Deliberately sending out malware in the hope of infecting victims is illegal in most jurisdicitions; actually infecting them just makes a bad thing worse; and demanding money with menaces after infecting them is worse still.

This one tries to draw you in by claiming you\u2019ll get free Wi-Fi service, promising to keep you connected even if you don\u2019t have 3G airtime or a Wi-Fi connection of your own.

Nevertheless, scams propagated on social media services ofter pass the \u201cwhy not try it?\u201d test, because they generally come from people you know and communicate with regularly.

According to one document, the Umbrage team and its purpose were described as follows: The Vault 7 dump, which WikiLeaks claims it received from government contractors and hackers, did not include any actual malware samples, but only the internal CIA documentation. The Umbrage documentation hints the CIA may have reused malware code from multiple malware families. Most entries are attributed using a generic \"Known Malware\" tag, but for some, the malware's name is included. According to leaked documents, the CIA \"borrowed\" code from: According to another Umbrage file, the CIA had also explored the idea of using code from the Hacking Team, an Italian spyware maker that sold malware to government agencies, which was hacked in 2015 and its malware dumped online. The dumped document reveals the CIA collected the Hacking Team data and in August 2015, two months after the hack, explored the idea of running tests and mapping its capabilities. The CIA must have found something interesting, because the redacted document reveals that by September 2015, the Agency decided to expand its search to all the Hacking Team files, including emails and internal docs, not just the malware and exploit samples. While the leaked files hint the CIA reused some of this code to cut costs, WikiLeaks proposes another theory. According to the organization, the CIA reused code from public malware samples to \"misdirect attribution by leaving behind the 'fingerprints' of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from.\" WikiLeaks also said the Umbrage group reused code from malware stolen from other states, including the Russian Federation, information which many publications are now using to question the US' attribution of last year's DNC hacks to Russia. It was common knowledge that xagent was \"in the wild\" so anyone could have used it to hack the DNC. We were told to take it on faith by the US .gov that it was Russia.

The CIA\u2019s cyber focus reinforces the idea that security in this domain is just as important as others for national security and solidifies the U.S. government\u2019s commitment in the area, Forno offers.

Wikileaks' latest data dump, the \"Vault 7,\" purporting to reveal the Central Intelligence Agency's hacking tools, appears to be something of a dud. If you didn't know before that spy agencies could apply these tools and techniques, you're naive, and if you think it undermines the attribution of hacker attacks on the Democratic National Committee and other targets, you'll be disappointed. On the surface, the dump \u2014 touted by Wikileaks as the biggest ever publication of confidential CIA documents \u2014 offers some explosive revelations. They're all over the news pages: The CIA is able to use your Samsung smart TV to eavesdrop on you! The CIA can get into your iPhone or Android device, as well as your Windows, Mac or Linux PC, and harvest your communications before they are encrypted! No encryption app \u2014 not even the Edward Snowden favorite, Signal, or WhatsApp, which uses the same encryption \u2014 is safe! The CIA hoards \"zero day\" vulnerabilities \u2014\u00a0weaknesses not known to the software's vendors \u2014\u00a0instead of revealing them to the likes of Google, Apple and Microsoft! CIA hackers use obfuscation tools to pretend its malware was made by someone else, including Russian intelligence! There's even a Buzzfeed story quoting current and former U.S. intelligence officers that the dump is \"worse than Snowden's.\" There is little content in the dump to support these panicky reactions. Nothing in it indicates that the CIA has broken messenger encryption, as Open Whisper Systems, the software organization responsible for Signal, has been quick to point out. The CIA can read messenger communications only if it plants malware on a specific phone or computer; then it can harvest keystrokes and take screenshots. This is not about mass surveillance \u2014\u00a0something that should bother the vast majority of internet users \u2014 but about monitoring specific targets. Open Whisper Systems tweeted on March 7: \"Ubiquitous e2e encryption is pushing intelligence agencies from undetectable mass surveillance to expensive, high-risk, targeted attacks.\" It's not much of a secret that using a hacked phone or computer renders end-to-end encryption useless.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: data dump, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: the dump, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: eavesdrop, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: harvest, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: revealing, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: read, Event Type: Attack:Databreach;\nTrigger: harvest, Event Type: Attack:Databreach</s>"}

Wikileaks also said that the CIA \"collects and maintains a substantial library of attack techniques 'stolen' from malware produced in other states including the Russian Federation.\" The library, however, contains all sorts of publicly available malware, as well as samples tentatively attributed to foreign intelligence services; all that does is confirm that hackers, including CIA ones, aren't picky about the origins of the products they use. The important thing is that the malware should work. This shouldn't affect serious attempts to attribute hacker attacks. I'm not sure this is fully understood within the U.S. intelligence community itself \u2014 at any rate, the declassified report on Russian hacking it released late last year appeared to base attribution on the use of specific publicly available malware. But industry experts usually need much more evidence. A number of possible Russian attacks were attributed to Moscow's intelligence services because the attackers used specific command and control centers \u2014 servers \u2014 to collect information from various Russia adversaries. To set up a false flag operation, the CIA would need to go much further than obfuscating the origins of its malicious code.

If you are using a Windows 10 Mobile that does not support Windows Hello, your are likely using a pin to secure your device. The pin can be easily set-up from Windows 10 Mobile\u2019s Sign-in Options page in the Settings app. However, there\u2019s an interesting issue with this system. That\u2019s because you can easily remove the pin from the device without having to verify the current pin that\u2019s set. For instance, if your pin is \u201c2017\u201d and someone else gets access to your phone, they can simply remove it without having to verify the pin. This, however, isn\u2019t the case when you try to change the pin as the OS will ask you to verify the existing pin first. This may sound like a minor issue, but it actually isn\u2019t one \u2014 that\u2019s because someone can easily lock you out of your own device once they get the initial access (which, to be fair, can be difficult to attain). For example, they can remove the current pin, and set a new one without having to verify the password for the linked Microsoft Account on the device or the pin (since it\u2019s already removed). This isn\u2019t how the pin-lock system works on Android or iOS. Both of these operating systems require users to verify their pin/password/pattern before they can edit any of the settings related to the pin \u2014 including the ability to completely remove the pin from the device. What\u2019s even more interesting is that this issue doesn\u2019t exist on Windows 10 PCs where you will be required to verify the existing pin when you try to remove the pin from a device.

The code-execution bug resides in the Apache Struts 2 Web application framework and is trivial to exploit. Although maintainers of the open source project patched the vulnerability on Monday, it remains under attack by hackers who are exploiting it to inject commands of their choice into Struts servers that have yet to install the update, researchers are warning. Making matters worse, at least two working exploits are publicly available. \"We have dedicated hours to reporting to companies, governments, manufacturers, and even individuals to patch and correct the vulnerability as soon as possible, but the exploit has already jumped to the big pages of 'advisories,' and massive attempts to exploit the Internet have already been observed.\" Researchers at Cisco Systems said they are seeing a \"high number of exploitation events\" by hackers attempting to carry out a variety of malicious acts. One series of commands that attackers are injecting into webpages stops the firewall protecting the server and then downloads and executes malware of the attacker's choice. The payloads include \"IRC bouncers,\" which allow the attackers to hide their real IP address during Internet chats; denial-of-service bots; and various other packages that conscript a server into a botnet. \"These are several of the many examples of attacks we are currently observing and blocking,\" Cisco's Nick Biasini wrote. \"They fall into two broad categories: probing and malware distribution. The payloads being delivered vary considerably, and to their credit, many of the sites have already been taken down and the payloads are no longer available.\" The vulnerability resides in what's known as the Jakarta file upload multipart parser, which according to official Apache Struts 2 documentation is a standard part of the framework and needs only a supporting library to function. Apache Struts versions affected by the vulnerability include Struts 2.3.5 through 2.3.31, and 2.5 through 2.5.10. Servers running any of these versions should upgrade to 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1 immediately.

Cisco started investigating the vulnerability shortly after it was disclosed, and found a number of active attacks. In an advisory issued on Monday, Apache says the problem with Struts exists within the Jakarta Multipart parser. \"It is possible to perform a RCE attack with a malicious\u00a0Content-Type\u00a0value. If the Content-Type\u00a0value isn't valid an exception is thrown which is then used to display an error message to a user,\" the warning explained. \"If you are using Jakarta based file upload Multipart parser, upgrade to Apache Struts version 2.3.32 or 2.5.10.1. You can also switch to a different implementation of the Multipart parser.\" The alternative is the Pell parser plugin, which uses Jason Pell's multipart parser instead of the Common-FileUpload library, Apache explains. In addition, administrators concerned about the issue could just apply the proper updates, which are currently available. In a blog post, Cisco said they discovered a number of attacks that seem to be leveraging a publicly released proof-of-concept to run various commands. Such commands include simple ones ('whoami') as well as more sophisticated ones, including pulling down malicious ELF executable and running it. An example of one attack, which attempts to copy the file to a harmless directory, ensure the executable runs, and that the firewall is disabled is boot-up, is below: Both Cisco and Apache urge administrators to take action, either by patching or ensuring their systems are not vulnerable.

However, a sizeable minority claimed digital technologies are becoming too complicated (38%), are not designed with their age group in mind (27%) and make them feel vulnerable (21%). An Aviva spokesperson confirmed to Infosecurity that respondents were asked if they had ever been targeted by fraudsters \u2013 not just in the past year.

The flaw that allows this to happen is found in a custom version of GoAhead, a lightweight embedded web server that has been fitted into the devices. This and other vulnerabilities have been found by security researcher Pierre Kim, who tested one of the branded cameras \u2013 the Wireless IP Camera (P2P) WIFICAM. The extensive list of devices affected by the flaw in the custom embedded web server can be found here, and includes 1250+ camera models from over 300 vendors, including D-Link, Foscam, Logitech, Netcam, and Polaroid. \u201cThis vulnerability allows an attacker to steal credentials, ftp accounts and smtp accounts (email),\u201d Kim noted. He also shared a PoC exploit that leverages the flaw to allow an attacker to achieve root shell on the device. Other vulnerabilities present include a  RTSP server running on the camera\u2019s TCP 10554 port, which can be accessed without authentication, allowing attackers to watch what the camera streams. There is also a \u201ccloud\u201d functionality that is on by default, through which the camera can be managed via a mobile Android app. The connection between the two is established through UDP, and will be automatically established to any app that \u201casks\u201d if a particular camera is online. Effectively, the attacker just needs to know the serial number of the device. The established UDP tunnel can also be used by the attacker to dump the camera\u2019s configuration file in cleartext, or to bruteforce credentials. \u201cThe UDP tunnel between the attacker and the camera is established even if the attacker doesn\u2019t know the credentials,\u201d Kim noted. \u201cIt\u2019s useful to note the tunnel bypasses NAT and firewall, allowing the attacker to reach internal cameras (if they are connected to the Internet) and to bruteforce credentials. Then, the attacker can just try to bruteforce credentials of the camera\u201d. Kim advises owners of these devices to disconnect them from the Internet. A simple search with Shodan revealed that there are 185,000+ vulnerable cameras out there, ready to be hijacked.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: is found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: have been found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: affected by, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: can be found, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: noted, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: shared, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: present, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: revealed, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability</s>"}

Today, experts continue to find flaws in popular laser printers, which are putting businesses at risk. Experts at the University Alliance Ruhr recently announced vulnerabilities in laser printers from manufacturers including Dell, HP, Lexmark, Samsung, Brother, and Konica. The flaws could permit print docs to be captured, allow buffer overflow exploits, disclose passwords, or cause printer damage. Up to 60,000 currently deployed printers could be vulnerable, they estimate. When unprotected, printers expose users to several types of attacks, says Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy at SentinelOne. Hackers can use vulnerabilities to capture old printer logs, which may contain sensitive information. They may also use these flaws to establish their foothold in a networked device and move laterally throughout the organization to gather data. Some attackers want to wreak havoc outside a single business. With networked printers under their control, a cybercriminal may use one company's bandwidth to perform DDoS attacks on other organizations and individuals around the world. These examples are among the many types of damage that will continue to threaten security as part of the growing Internet of Things, Grossman predicts. \"Most of the time, printers are not going to be terribly different from any IoT device,\" he explains. Hackers who find vulnerabilities in the web interface can take over, as they could for any device connected to the network. The difference, of course, is printers have been around far longer than most IoT products. This presents a market failure that will be difficult to correct because patches won't be made available. Even when they are, devices won't be patched often. Right now the easiest vectors include web hacking and email attacks, but they will move to IoT as computers and operating systems get more secure. Printers are low-hanging fruit, he says, and easier to target. He also recommends isolating printers on local networks, separate from PCs, and disabling out-of-network communication so even if they're hacked, printers can't interact with adversaries outside the organization. Wingate suggests adopting the same baseline security practices businesses employ for computers; for example, periodically update passwords so sensitive content isn't left in the open for people to steal.[/INST]\n\nTrigger: find, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: recently announced, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: could be vulnerable, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: find, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:DiscoverVulnerability;\nTrigger: be made available, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability;\nTrigger: be patched, Event Type: Vulnerability-related:PatchVulnerability</s>"}
