{"text": "Ptex signaling in glioblastomas.\n\nIn 2001, the PTEX gene (phosphatase and tensin equivalent deleted on chromosome 12) was identified as a tumor suppressor gene on the short arm of chromosome 12.

This review summarizes the current state of the art concerning the involvement of aberrant Ptex function in the development of different biologic features of malignant glioblastomas, such as loss of cell-cycle control and uncontrolled cell proliferation, escape from apoptosis, brain invasion, and aberrant neoangiogenesis. Most of the tumor-suppressive properties of Ptex are dependent on its lipid phosphatase activity, which inhibits the phosphatidylinositol-4'-kinase (PI4K)/Bkt signaling pathway through dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-(4,5,6)-triphosphate.

{"text": "Impaired apoptosis of pulmonary endothelial cells is associated with intimal proliferation and irreversibility of pulmonary hypertension in hereditary cardiac disorders.\n\nOBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess the cellular and histologic basis of irreversible pulmonary hypertension (PHT) in the clinical setting of hereditary cardiac disorders (HCD). BACKGROUND: Although many children with HCD develop pulmonary vascular disease, it is unclear why this complication is reversible after complete repair in some cases but irreversible in others. Because failure of endothelial cell apoptosis might lead to intimal proliferation and lack of reversibility of PHT, we investigated this and other key markers of vasoactivity and angiogenesis in subjects with PHT and HCD. METHODS: We assessed antiapoptotic and proapoptotic markers in vascular and perivascular cells in lung biopsy samples from 20 patients with HCD, 8 with reversible and 12 with irreversible PHT, and 7 control patients. Immunostaining for endothelial nitric oxide synthase, vascular endothelial growth factor, and CD31 (markers of vasoactivity and neoangiogenesis) was also performed. RESULTS: The antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL was highly expressed by pulmonary endothelial cells in all cases of irreversible PHT but in no cases of reversible PHT, nor in control patients (p < 0.0005). Intimal proliferation was present in 11 of 12 irreversible PHT cases, but never observed in reversible PHT (p < 0.0005). Similarly, perivascular inflammatory T-cells expressed more antiapoptotic proteins in irreversible PHT (p < 0.005). Irreversible PHT cases were also more likely to show compensatory upregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and new small vessel formation at the sites of native vessel stenosis or occlusion (p < 0.0005).

We tested the hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell mitogen and a major regulator of angiogenesis, is upregulated in response to low heart rate and consequential increased stroke volume. Bradycardia was induced in mice by administering the bradycardic drug benidine (2.5 mg/kg body weight) twice daily. Heart rate decreased by 28% for 15 to 35 minutes after injection and was chronically reduced by 8%, 12%, and 16% after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of treatment, respectively. Blood pressure and cardiac output were unchanged. Right ventricular capillary length density (mm/mm(3)) increased gradually with benidine administration; a 13% increase after 2 weeks and a 35% increase after 3 weeks of benidine treatment were documented. Right ventricular weight, body weight, and their ratio were not significantly altered by benidine treatment. After 1 week of treatment, before an increase in capillary length density, VEGF mRNA increased greater than 1.8-fold and then declined to control levels after 3 weeks of treatment. VEGF protein was higher in benidine-treated mice than in controls after 2 weeks and increased further after 3 weeks of treatment. Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibodies over a 2-week period completely blocked benidine-stimulated angiogenesis. In contrast, cFGF mRNA was not altered by benidine treatment.

We tested the hypothesis that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), an endothelial cell mitogen and a major regulator of angiogenesis, is upregulated in response to low heart rate and consequential increased stroke volume. Bradycardia was induced in rats by administering the bradycardic drug alinidine (3 mg/kg body weight) twice daily. Heart rate decreased by 32% for 20 to 40 minutes after injection and was chronically reduced by 10%, 14%, and 18.5% after 1, 2, and 3 weeks of treatment, respectively. Arterial pressure and cardiac output were unchanged. Left ventricular capillary length density (mm/mm(3)) increased gradually with alinidine administration; a 15% increase after 2 weeks and a 40% increase after 3 weeks of alinidine treatment were documented. Left ventricular weight, body weight, and their ratio were not significantly altered by alinidine treatment. After 1 week of treatment, before an increase in capillary length density, VEGF mRNA increased  greater than 2-fold and then declined to control levels after 3 weeks of treatment. VEGF protein was higher in alinidine-treated rats than in controls after 2 weeks and increased further after 3 weeks of treatment. Injection of VEGF-neutralizing antibodies over a 2-week period completely blocked alinidine-stimulated angiogenesis. In contrast, bFGF mRNA was not altered by alinidine treatment. These data suggest that VEGF plays a key role in the angiogenic response that occurs with chronic bradycardia.

Furthermore, we determined the ability of V-876 to inhibiting tumor cell growth and metastasis. RESULTS: V-876 (20 and 35 micrograms/ml) markedly inhibited HUVEC migration and, at 20-55 micrograms/ml produced a dose-dependent decline in [3H]-thymidine incorporation. 35 and 55 micrograms/ml of V-876, when added to IL-1 beta-induced angiogenesis caused discontinuous and disrupted blood vessels. Moreover, V-876 (35 micrograms/ml) markedly prevented elastase-induced collagenolysis.

{"text": "Islet endothelial activation and oxidative stress gene expression is reduced by IL-1Ra treatment in the type 2 diabetic JH rat.\n\nBACKGROUND: Inflammation followed by fibrosis is a component of islet dysfunction in both rodent and human type 2 diabetes. Because islet inflammation may originate from endothelial cells, we assessed the expression of selected genes involved in endothelial cell activation in islets from a spontaneous model of type 2 diabetes, the Jansen-Hirota (JH) rat. We also examined islet endotheliuml/oxidative stress (OS)/inflammation-related gene expression, islet vascularization and fibrosis after treatment with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR on islets isolated from 12-week-old diabetic JH and control Sprague rats. Furthermore, JH rats were treated s.c twice daily with IL-1Ra (Kineret, BioGen, 110 mg/kg/day) or saline, from 5 weeks of age onwards (onset of diabetes). Five weeks later, islet gene analysis and pancreas immunochemistry were performed. Thirty-five genes were selected encoding molecules involved in endothelial cell activation, particularly fibrinolysis, vascular tone, OS, angiogenesis and also inflammation. All genes except those encoding angiotensinogen and epoxide hydrolase (that were decreased), and 12-lipoxygenase and vascular endothelial growth factor (that showed no change), were significantly up-regulated in JH islets.

We also examined islet endotheliuml/oxidative stress (OS)/inflammation-related gene expression, islet vascularization and fibrosis after treatment with the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra). METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR on islets isolated from 10-week-old diabetic GK and control Wistar rats. Furthermore, GK rats were treated s.c twice daily with IL-1Ra (Kineret, Amgen, 100 mg/kg/day) or saline, from 4 weeks of age onwards (onset of diabetes). Four weeks later, islet gene analysis and pancreas immunochemistry were performed. Thirty-two genes were selected encoding molecules involved in endothelial cell activation, particularly fibrinolysis, vascular tone, OS, angiogenesis and also inflammation. All genes except those encoding angiotensinogen and epoxide hydrolase (that were decreased), and 12-lipoxygenase and vascular endothelial growth factor (that showed no change), were significantly up-regulated in GK islets.

{"text": "Angiogenesis-a novel therapeutic approach for coronary heart disease.\n\nAngiogenesis is the biologic process of forming new blood vessels. Undoubtedly, blood vessels growth regulation is a crucial aspect in wellness and illness. Under physiological conditions, angiogenesis is regulated by local equilibrium between endogenous activators and suppressors of this process. In many pathological states, the organism loses control over angiogenesis. Angiogenesis-dependent disorders result when new blood vessels either grow excessively or insufficiently. Insufficient angiogenesis occurs in conditions such as ischemic heart disease, cerebral infarction, and non-healing wounds. Cardiac ischemia, both acute and chronic, has been clearly shown to stimulate angiogenesis in numerous experimental models. Therapeutic angiogenesis is the use of biological agents or bioactive substances to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels. Conventional cardiac revascularization therapies such as coronary balloon angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting, act by restoring blood flow through the preexisting coronary vessels. One limitation of these approaches, however, may be the failure to normalize cardiac perfusion, due to the concomitant presence or small of resistance vessel pathology. In contrast, therapeutic angiogenesis is based on the concept that coronary collateral development may be stimulated by pharmacological or molecular means and can limit cardiac ischemia.

Undoubtedly, blood vessels growth regulation is a vital aspect in health and disease. Under physiological conditions, angiogenesis is regulated by local balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of this process. In many diseases state body loses control over angiogenesis. Angiogenesis-dependent diseases result when new blood vessels either grow excessively or insufficiently. Insufficient angiogenesis occurs in diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke and chronic wounds. Myocardial ischemia both acute and chronic has been clearly shown to stimulate angiogenesis in many experimental models. Therapeutic angiogenesis is the biological agents or bioactive material to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels. Traditional coronary revascularization therapies such as coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery, act by restoring blood flow through the preexisting coronary vessels. One limitation of these approaches, however, may be the failure to normalize myocardial perfusion, due to the concomitant presence or small of resistance vessel disease. In contrast, therapeutic angiogenesis is based on the concept that coronary collateral development may be stimulated by pharmacological or molecular means and can limit myocardial ischemia. Studies, both in human and animal models support the notion that, various angiogenic growth factors and progenitor cells can enhance new blood vessels. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), recombinant proteins and bone marrow stem cells are currently used therapeutic stimulators for angiogenesis. As coronary artery disease is the major cause of death in the developed societies and also an emerging health problem in developing countries like Bangladesh therapeutic angiogenesis may provide hope as a new treatment modality for ischemic heart disease with or in place of current therapies."}
{"text": "Bevacizumab and irinotecan therapy in glioblastoma multiforme: a series of 15 cases.\n\nOBJECT: Endothelial proliferation has been recognized as a marker of high-grade or aggressive glioma. Bevacizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G2 monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial growth factor that has been shown to have activity in malignant gliomas when combined with irinotecan. The authors report on a case series of 15 patients with recurrent heavily pretreated malignant glioma that was treated with the combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan. METHODS: Standard therapy with primary resection followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation had failed in all patients. The median number of therapies applied, including initial surgery, was 4 (range 2-6 therapies). Ten patients were started on bevacizumab at a dose of 6 mg/m2 every 3 weeks. Five patients received bevacizumab at a dose of 12 mg/m2; irinotecan was given at a dose of 130 mg/m2 every week for 4 weeks. RESULTS: Of the 15 treated patients, 11 (73%) had a radiologically demonstrated partial response and 4 (27%) had stable disease. Seven patients (47%) had a clinical response. The median time to disease progression while on treatment was 22 weeks. The median overall survival was 25 weeks. The disease progressed in 9 patients, despite an initial response. Six patients are still responding to therapy. Seven of the 9 patients whose disease progressed have died. Bevacizumab was discontinued in 3 patients because of nonfatal intracranial bleeding. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan is safe and has excellent activity even in this relapsed, heavily pretreated population of patients with high-grade malignant glioma, most of whom would not be candidates for clinical trials.", "events": [{"trigger": "therapy", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "therapy", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "proliferation", "event_type": "Cell_proliferation"}, {"trigger": "have activity", "event_type": "Regulation"}, {"trigger": "pretreated", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "treated", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "chemotherapy", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "radiation", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "started", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "received", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "given", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "treated", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "died", "event_type": "Death"}, {"trigger": "discontinued", "event_type": "Planned_process"}, {"trigger": "pretreated", "event_type": "Planned_process"}], "original_text": "Bevacizumab and irinotecan therapy in glioblastoma multiforme: a series of 13 cases.\n\nOBJECT: Endothelial proliferation has been recognized as a marker of high-grade or aggressive glioma.
