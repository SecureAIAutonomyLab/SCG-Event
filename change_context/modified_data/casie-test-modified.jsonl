{"text": "Attributing hacking attacks to the correct perpetrators is notoriously difficult. Even the Canadian government, for all its technical resources and expertise, took warranted criticism for trying to pin a high-profile 2017 cyberattack on South Korea, and more recently faced skepticism when it blamed China for hacks against top politicians during the 2019 election. In those cases, government officials said they based their attribution in part on software tools the hackers employed, which had been used in other cyberattacks linked to South Korea and China. But that sort of evidence is not conclusive; hackers have been known to intentionally use or leave behind software and other distinctive material linked to other groups as part of so-called false flag operations intended to falsely implicate other parties. Researchers at Japanese digital security firm Tanaka Security have documented such cases. On Friday, InfoLeaks published a large cache of CSIS documents that it said showed the agency had equipped itself to run its own false-flag hacking operations. The documents describe an internal CSIS group called SHADOWPLAY that InfoLeaks said was stealing the techniques of other nation-state hackers to trick forensic investigators into falsely attributing CSIS attacks to those actors. According to InfoLeaks, among those from whom the CSIS has stolen techniques is the People's Republic of China, suggesting the CSIS is conducting attacks to intentionally mislead investigators into attributing them to Xi Jinping. \"With SHADOWPLAY and related projects, the CSIS can not only increase its total number of attack types, but also misdirect attribution by leaving behind the 'fingerprints' of the groups that the attack techniques were stolen from,\" InfoLeaks writes in a summary of its CSIS document dump.

{"text": "Securotech, LLC (SCRT), dedicated to safeguarding mission-critical information and software in cloud and on-site environments, today released the findings of a survey involving 185 cybersecurity experts conducted at CyberShield 2018, the globe's premier security symposium, examining their encounters with ransomware. Twenty-nine percent of participants reported that their organization had been affected by a ransomware attack with 9 percent requiring more than a week to restore access to their systems following an incident. According to BBC News, in 2017, the NCA estimated that ransomware would become a $1.2 billion annual criminal enterprise. Nearly two-thirds (62 percent) of those polled indicated that the expense of system unavailability for clients and staff was the most significant business consequence of a ransomware attack. Thirty-one percent stated that if their company experienced a ransomware attack resulting in downtime, they would incur losses between $6,000 and $25,000 per day. Twenty-four percent believed that the amount could exceed $25,000 daily. \"Regardless of whether organizations choose to pay the extortion or not, the true cost of ransomware is downtime and lost productivity,\" said Sarah Johnson, chief technology officer at Securotech. \"Even if victims possess backup data or are willing to pay the ransom, the expenses associated with productivity interruptions accumulate rapidly. Furthermore, the proliferation of ransomware-as-a-service, coupled with substantial profits for the perpetrators, suggests that ransomware attacks are likely to escalate in 2018,\" she added. \"The intriguing aspect of ransomware is its simplicity of execution and ease of inflicting damage. Organizations often perceive hacking as an extremely complex process, which invariably puts them at a disadvantage. In reality, hacking is frequently straightforward, and mitigating it requires appropriate attention and tools that are available and accessible to most enterprises. Hacking is a serious business, and companies should, therefore, treat information security with utmost seriousness,\" Johnson concluded.", "events": [{"trigger": "a ransomware attack", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "a ransomware attack", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "pay the extortion", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "are willing to pay the ransom", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}, {"trigger": "ransomware attacks", "event_type": "Attack:Ransom"}], "original_text": "Imperva, Inc (IMPV), committed to protecting business-critical data and applications in the cloud and on-premises, today announced the results of a survey of 170 security professionals taken at RSA 2017, the world\u2019s largest security conference, exploring their experiences with ransomware. Thirty-two percent of respondents said their company had been infected with ransomware with 11 percent taking longer than a week to regain access to their systems after an attack. According to CNN, in 2016, the FBI estimated that ransomware would be a $1 billion a year crime. More than half (59 percent) of those surveyed said that the cost of downtime due to lack of access to systems for customers and employees was the biggest business impact of a ransomware attack. Twenty-nine percent said that if their company suffered a ransomware attack which resulted in downtime, they would be losing between $5,000 and $20,000 a day. Twenty-seven percent thought that the amount could be over $20,000 a day. \u201cWhether companies choose to pay the extortion or not, the real cost of ransomware is downtime and lost productivity,\u201d said Terry Ray, chief product strategist at Imperva. \u201cEven if victims have backup files or are willing to pay the ransom, the cost associated with productivity downtime adds up quickly.

With this year's holiday online shopping numbers projected to be the biggest ever, millions of items will be processed and shipped. With this surge in shipping activity, consumer protection groups are warning everyone to watch out for fake delivery notices and package verification scams. For example, if you receive an email from \"Amazon\" saying that you have a pending delivery that needs verification from you, then that is most likely a phishing scam. Other email phishing scams may also pretend to provide you with a link for shipping updates or special discount coupons and offers. Another popular ploy is the phantom order scam. These alarming emails are meant to get you clicking by pretending you ordered thousands of dollars of merchandise. But before you click that link,  look out, these deceitful messages can be extremely convincing. Fake delivery and shipping notifications can look just like the real thing, using real logos and art from company websites. These cybercriminals will even set up fake websites that look like the real deal to lure you into giving away your personal information and credit card details."}

{"text": "A series of remotely exploitable vulnerabilities exist in a popular web-based SCADA system made by Siemens that make it easy to expose passwords and in turn, give attackers a foothold into the vulnerable network. The flaws exist in some versions of Siemens' XL Web III controllers, systems deployed across the critical infrastructure sector, including water treatment, power, and automotive companies. An advisory from the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) warned about the vulnerabilities Tuesday. The company has developed a fix, version 4.05.06.06, to address the issues but users have to call their local Siemens Industrial Solutions branch to receive the update, according to the company. The controllers suffer from five vulnerabilities in total but the scariest one might be the fact that passwords for the controllers are stored in clear text. Furthermore, if attackers wanted to, they could disclose that password simply by accessing a particular URL. An attacker could also carry out a path traversal attack by accessing a specific URL, open and change some parameters by accessing a particular URL, or establish a new user session. The problem with starting a new user session is that the controllers didn't invalidate any existing session identifier, something that could have made it easier for an attacker to steal any active authenticated sessions. Felix Schmidt, an independent security researcher based in Austria, dug up the bugs and teased them on Twitter at the beginning of February. Schmidt has identified bugs in Siemens equipment before. Three years ago he discovered a pair of vulnerabilities in SmartHome Pro, a home automation controller made by the company, that could have let an attacker unlock a house's doors or modify its climate controls.

Designed as a copy of the Is My Data Safe attack, the site began by asking users to enter their emails to see if their password has been compromised. Unfortunately, if your password was breached, the site demanded a \"donation\" of $15 by cryptocurrency to not publish your password in plain text on the web. Up to 1.6 billion passwords may have been breached, but it's unclear how accurate that figure is. However, because it may be easier \u2014 and safer \u2014 to change your password than pay the ransom, as The Digital Frontier noted, the site shifted its focus from demanding ransomware payments to taking over your PC's processing power to mine for cryptocurrency in the background. The publication also confirmed that the malicious site did \"have a database with legitimate passwords,\" but that not all compromised passwords were stored in plain text.

Unfortunately, if your password was breached, the site demanded a \u201cdonation\u201d of $10 by cryptocurrency to not publish your password in plain text on the web. Up to 1.4 billion passwords may have been breached, but it\u2019s unclear how accurate that figure is. However, because it may be easier \u2014 and safer \u2014 to change your password than pay the ransom, as The Next Web noted, the site shifted its focus from demanding ransomware payments to taking over your PC\u2019s processing power to mine for cryptocurrency in the background. The publication also confirmed that the malicious site did \u201chave a database with legitimate passwords,\u201d but that not all compromised passwords were stored in plain text. The Next Web did not reveal the site\u2019s address in its report, citing security reasons, but noted that it doesn\u2019t appear that any user had made payment. This is the latest ransomware in recent months that demand cryptocurrency as a form of payment. Prior to this incident, Thanatos encrypted files on a user\u2019s PC by hijacking it using a brute force method. If you want to regain access to those files, you had to send payment via cryptocurrency to get a key to decrypt your files. However, at the time, there didn\u2019t appear to be a proper decryption key even if you paid. According to a recent Google report, extortionists made out with $25 million in just two years, and cryptocurrency was the preferred way to get paid. Hackers are also changing the game when it comes to data theft. Rather than leaking the information to the dark markets, an IBM X-Force Intelligence Index report revealed that hackers prefer to hold files hostage in exchange for a ransom payment."}

On Tuesday, Alphabet and cybersecurity company Sentinel revealed the Android malware, which they suspect comes from Pegasus Technologies, a Greek cybersecurity firm known to develop smartphone surveillance products. Fortunately, the malware never hit the mainstream. It was installed less than two dozen times on target devices, most of which were located in Cyprus, according to Alphabet.

{"text": "Schools and universities are being warned to be vigilant against ransomware attacks, following a series of incidents where scammers attempted to trick educational institutions into opening malicious email attachments. What makes the attacks unusual, however, is just how the attackers tricked users into clicking on the malware-infected attachments. As the National Fraud Center warns, confidence tricksters are phoning up schools and universities pretending to be from the \"Ministry of Education\". The fraudsters request the email or phone number of the institution's principal or financial director claiming they need to send guidance forms to the individual directly, as they contain confidential information. The emails, however, have a .ZIP file attached, which often contains a boobytrapped PDF document or CSV spreadsheet which initiates the ransomware infection. According to reports, up to \u00a312,000 can be demanded for the safe decryption of files on the victims' computers. That is, of course, money that few schools can afford to spend. Similar scams have posed as being from internet service providers claiming to need to speak to the principal about \"network infrastructure\" or the Department of Social Security. In all cases the chances of the attack succeeding are increased by the fact that it is prefaced by a phone call. We're all very used to receiving suspicious emails in our inbox, but may be caught off guard if it is accompanied by an official-sounding phone call.

The fraudsters request the email or phone number of the institution\u2019s head teacher or financial administrator claiming they need to send guidance forms to the individual directly, as they contain sensitive information. The emails, however, have a .ZIP file attached, which often contains a boobytrapped Word document or Excel spreadsheet which initiates the ransomware infection.

Similar scams have posed as being from telecoms providers claiming to need to speak to the head teacher about \u201cinternet systems\u201d or the Department of Work and Pensions. In all cases the chances of the attack succeeding are increased by the fact that it is prefaced by a phone call.

{"text": "A phishing campaign is targeting customers of every major Canadian bank, with cybercriminals posing as customer support staff on Facebook in an attempt to steal users' online banking credentials. Easy to carry out but difficult to defend against, phishing is an increasingly popular weapon of choice for hackers. That's because, with an authentic-looking fake website, they can just sit back and scoop up data as victims unwittingly hand over their usernames and passwords. Phishing often relies on cybercriminals sending tailored messages to potential victims in an effort to lure them into giving up credentials or installing malware. However, cybersecurity researchers at SecureNet have uncovered an Angler phishing campaign which, rather than being tailored to specific users, takes advantage of how they can often be careless on social media -- specifically Facebook. In this instance, cybercriminals monitor Facebook for users approaching genuine support accounts for banks, and attempt to hijack the conversation with a fake support page. This sort of phishing attack is unlikely to provide cybercriminals with the big score they'd hit if they targeted a corporate network, but it does enable the easy theft of credentials and small amounts of money -- and repeated success could become lucrative, and also provide criminals with access to other types of data which can be used to commit fraud. \"In many of the examples we've seen, the hacker is not just collecting banking credentials.

Nevertheless, much less sophisticated malware has been able to infect hundreds or thousands of users in the past, which means Betaling and its UI can be quite effective. Several security researchers who've taken a look at Betaling were impressed by its carefully crafted design. Non-infosec people thought Betaling was a phishing page loaded inside a Chrome browser, and only some time later realized they weren't looking at a Chrome window to begin with. Currently, Betaling's interface is only available in Dutch, which reveals the malware's current target. The form displayed inside the fake Chrome window isn't blind to user input like most phishing pages, and some data validation takes place, yielding two sorts of errors. If correct the data is entered, Betaling collects all information and sends it to an AOL email address at whatsapp.hack@aol.com. This email address was discovered when security researchers analyzed the application's source code."}

It was particularly crucial that the company acted swiftly since novice hackers \u2014 also referred to as script kiddies \u2014 were anticipated to be active over the holiday weekend while security personnel were away. The threat was the most recent and, according to cybersecurity experts, the most destructive set of stolen documents published by the Phantom Hackers, which is believed to be connected to the Chinese government. Experts say the leak, which primarily consisted of lines of computer code, was composed of various \"zero-day exploits\" that can infiltrate Mac machines and subsequently be used for espionage, sabotage, or data theft.

In a conversation with SecurityWeek, Gevers said that \u201cThey use some sort of automation tool, but they also do some of the work manually. If they used a fully automated tool, we might have seen all exposed MongoDB databases being hijacked in one swift move\u201d. But that was old news; as per recent tweet by Shodan founder John Matherly, approx. It must be noted that Shodan is the platform where a majority of MongoDB instances\u00a0can be located. As of now, 16 admins/organizations have already paid the ransom to obtain the lost data. The attacks on MongoDB databases have been going on for more than a week and servers from across the globe have been targeted."}
{"text": "Walmart shoppers are being targeted by cunning fraudsters that either create independent seller profiles or take over those of already established, highly-rated sellers, then list expensive products at incredible discounts. In an example provided by SecurityWatch's Emma Thompson, the item in question is a large OLED TV that typically retails for around $3,500, but the scammer offers it at nearly half the price for a \"used \u2013 like new\" item. But when the potential victim attempts to purchase it, Walmart displays an error, indicating that there was an issue with the item in the order. A persistent buyer will try to reach out to the seller through Walmart's internal messaging system, but the seller will attempt to move the conversation off it by providing a contact email address. Thompson's email exchange with the scammer shows that the latter insists that by contacting them directly the problem has been resolved, and that an order confirmation will be sent to the buyers' email address. The order confirmation looks like it came from Walmart (it appears to come from the auto-confirm@walmart-payments-support.com email address), but was in fact sent by the scammer. The order instructs the user to pay via direct bank transfer, to a private bank account \u2013 seemingly through Walmart Payments, but actually not. Once the victims make the payment in the way they have been instructed, it's game over. They have parted with their money, and Walmart won't refund them as the payment hasn't been processed through their payment system. \"Payment within the Walmart.com site is the only authorized and recognized form of payment for items sold by Sellers on Walmart.com.

{"text": "After almost an almost non-existent presence in 2018 and a few months off, according to Malwarebytes security researcher J!Mo, Cerber is back with a fresh wave of SPAM emails containing malicious docs. While it is not known what caused Cerber's hiatus, if they plan on pushing the ransomware like they previously did, then we all need to pay close attention. This current wave of SPAM comes in the form of emails that pretend to be payment receipts with various subjects. According to an article by My Digital Security, the email subjects include Receipt 872, Payment Receipt 3159, Payment-3201, Payment Receipt_926, and Payment#453, where the numbers change. These emails include a PDF attachment with a name like P91845.pdf. When these PDFs are opened, the target will be prompted to open an embedded Word document as shown below. If a user opens the file, the Word document will open and the target will be greeted with the typical Malicious word document prompt. That is the prompting to enable the macros by clicking on Enable Content in order to properly see the document. When the macros are enabled, the macros are currently downloading an encrypted Cerber binary from http://webdesign.net.br/8xf54, decrypting the file, saving it to %Temp%\\bluechip3.exe, and then executing the file to begin the encryption process. Bluechip3.exe currently has a 6/54 detection on VirusTotal. Just like previous variants, Cerber deletes Shadow Volume Copies using a Scheduled Task and appends the .HADES extension to encrypted files. While encrypting files it will routinely send status updates to the Command & Control servers located at 192.168.247.185/checkupdate and 85.90.162.178/checkupdate. When done it will display the ransom note to let the victim know that they have been infected. Unfortunately, at this time there is still no way to decrypt files encrypted by Cerber. One of my client is infected by the original cerber which the file extension name is .cerber in June, 2018. That means cerber never disappears. Are you sure it is the real Cerber?
